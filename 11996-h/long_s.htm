<h2>PRELIMINARY REMARKS BY THE EDITOR.</h2>
<p>The following Letters were &#383;ubmitted to my in&#383;pection
and judgement by the Author, of who&#383;e principles and abilities
I had rea&#383;on to entertain a very high opinion. How far my
judgement has been exerci&#383;ed to advantage in enforcing the
propriety of introducing them to the public, that public mu&#383;t
decide. To me, I confe&#383;s, it appeared, that a &#383;eries of
important facts, tending to throw a &#383;trong light on the
internal &#383;tate of France, during the mo&#383;t important
period of the Revolution, could neither prove unintere&#383;ting to
the general reader, nor indifferent to the future hi&#383;torian of
that momentous epoch; and I conceived, that the oppo&#383;ite and
judicious reflections of a well-formed and well-cultivated mind,
naturally ari&#383;ing out of events within the immediate
&#383;cope of its own ob&#383;ervation, could not in the
&#383;malle&#383;t degree dimini&#383;h the intere&#383;t which, in
my apprehen&#383;ion, they are calculated to excite. My advice upon
this occa&#383;ion was farther influenced by another
con&#383;ideration. Having traced, with minute attention, the
progre&#383;s of the revolution, and the conduct of its advocates,
I had remarked the extreme affiduity employed (as well by
tran&#383;lations of the mo&#383;t violent productions of the
Gallic pre&#383;s, as by original compo&#383;itions,) to introduce
and propagate, in foreign countries, tho&#383;e pernicious
principles which have already &#383;apped the foundation of
&#383;ocial order, de&#383;troyed the happine&#383;s of millions,
and &#383;pread de&#383;olation and ruin over the fine&#383;t
country in Europe. I had particularly ob&#383;erved the incredible
efforts exerted in England, and, I am &#383;orry to &#383;ay, with
too much &#383;ucce&#383;s, for the ba&#383;e purpo&#383;e of
giving a fal&#383;e colour to every action of the per&#383;ons
exerci&#383;ing the powers of government in France; and I had
marked, with indignation, the atrociou&#383; attempt to &#383;trip
vice of its deformity, to dre&#383;s crime in the garb of virtue,
to decorate &#383;lavery with the &#383;ymbols of freedom, and give
to folly the attributes of wi&#383;dom. I had &#383;een, with
extreme concern, men, whom the lenity, mi&#383;taken lenity, I
mu&#383;t call it, of our government had re&#383;cued from
puni&#383;hment, if not from ruin, bu&#383;ily engaged in thi&#383;
&#383;candalous traffic, and, availing them&#383;elves of their
exten&#383;ive connections to diffu&#383;e, by an infinite variety
of channels, the poi&#383;on of democracy over their native land.
In &#383;hort, I had &#383;een the Briti&#383;h pre&#383;s, the
grand palladium of Briti&#383;h liberty, devoted to the cau&#383;e
of Gallic licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s, that mortal enemy of all
freedom, and even the pure &#383;tream of Briti&#383;h
critici&#383;m diverted from its natural cour&#383;e, and polluted
by the pe&#383;tilential vapours of Gallic republicani&#383;m. I
therefore deemed it e&#383;&#383;ential, by an exhibition of
well-authenticated facts, to correct, as far as might be, the evil
effects of mi&#383;repre&#383;entation and error, and to defend the
empire of truth, which had been a&#383;&#383;ailed by a ho&#383;t
of foes.</p>
<p>My opinion of the principles on which the pre&#383;ent
&#383;y&#383;tem of government in France was founded, and the war
to which tho&#383;e principles gave ri&#383;e, have been long
&#383;ince &#383;ubmitted to the public. Sub&#383;equent events,
far from invalidating, have &#383;trongly confirmed it. In all the
public declaration&#383; of the Directory, in their dome&#383;tic
polity, in their conduct to foreign powers, I plainly trace the
prevalence of the &#383;ame principles, the &#383;ame contempt for
the rights and happine&#383;s of the people, the &#383;ame
&#383;pirit of aggre&#383;&#383;ion and aggrandizement, the
&#383;ame eagerne&#383;s to overturn the exi&#383;ting
in&#383;titutions of neighbouring &#383;tates, and the &#383;ame
de&#383;ire to promote "the univer&#383;al revolution of Europe,"
which marked the conduct of BRISSOT, LE BRUN, DESMOULINS,
ROBESPIERRE, and their di&#383;ciples. Indeed, what &#383;tronger
in&#383;tance need be adduced of the continued prevalence of
the&#383;e principles, than the promotion to the &#383;upreme rank
in the &#383;tate, of two men who took an active part in the
mo&#383;t atrocious proceedings of the Convention at the clo&#383;e
of 1792, and at the commencement of the following year?</p>
<p>In all the various con&#383;titutions which have been
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively adopted in that devoted country, the
welfare of the people has been wholly di&#383;regarded, and while
they have been amu&#383;ed with the &#383;hadow of liberty, they
have been cruelly de&#383;poiled of the &#383;ub&#383;tance. Even
on the e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of the pre&#383;ent
con&#383;titution, the one which bore the neare&#383;t
re&#383;emblance to a rational &#383;y&#383;tem, the freedom of
election, which had been frequently proclaimed as the very
corner-&#383;tone of liberty, was &#383;hamefully violated by the
legi&#383;lative body, who, in their eagerne&#383;s to perpetuate
their own power, did not &#383;cruple to de&#383;troy the principle
on which it wa&#383; founded. Nor is this the only violation of
their own principles. A French writer has aptly ob&#383;erved, that
"En revolution comme en morale, ce n'e&#383;t que le premier pas
qui coute:" thus the executive, in imitation of the
legi&#383;lative body, &#383;eem di&#383;po&#383;ed to render their
power perpetual. For though it be expre&#383;&#383;ly declared by
the 137th article of the 6th title of their pre&#383;ent
con&#383;titutional code, that the "Directory &#383;hall be
partially renewed by the election of a new member every year," no
&#383;tep towards &#383;uch election has been taken, although the
time pre&#383;cribed by the law i&#383; elap&#383;ed.&mdash;In a
private letter from Paris now before me, written within the&#383;e
few days, is the following ob&#383;ervation on this very
circum&#383;tance: "The con&#383;titution has received another
blow. The month of Vendemiaire i&#383; pa&#383;t, and our Directors
&#383;till remain the &#383;ame. Hence we begin to drop the
appalation of Directory, and &#383;ub&#383;titute that of the
Cinqvir, who are more to be dreaded for their power, and more to be
dete&#383;ted for their crimes, than the Decemvir of ancient Rome."
The &#383;ame letter al&#383;o contains a brief ab&#383;tract of
the &#383;tate of the metropolis of the French republic, which is
wonderfully characteri&#383;tic of the attention of the government
to the welfare and happine&#383;s of its inhabitant&#383;!</p>
<p>"The reign of mi&#383;ery and of crime &#383;eems to be
perpetuated in thi&#383; di&#383;tracted capital: &#383;uicides,
pillage, and a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inations, are daily
committed, and are &#383;till &#383;uffered to pa&#383;s unnoticed.
But what render&#383; our &#383;ituation &#383;till more
deplorable, is the exi&#383;tence of an innumerable band of
&#383;pies, who infe&#383;t all public places, and all private
&#383;ocieties. More than a hundred thou&#383;and of the&#383;e men
are regi&#383;tered on the books of the modern SARTINE; and as the
population of Paris, at mo&#383;t, does not exceed &#383;ix hundred
thou&#383;and &#383;ouls, we are &#383;ure to find in &#383;ix
individual&#383; one &#383;py. This con&#383;ideration makes me
&#383;hudder, and, accordingly, all confidence, and all the
&#383;weets of &#383;ocial intercour&#383;e, are bani&#383;hed from
among us. People &#383;alute each other, look at each other, betray
mutual &#383;u&#383;picions, ob&#383;erve a profound &#383;ilence,
and part. This, in few words, i&#383; an exact de&#383;cription of
our modern republican parties. It is &#383;aid, that poverty has
compelled many re&#383;pectable per&#383;ons, and even
&#383;tate-creditors, to enli&#383;t under the &#383;tandard of
COCHON, (the Police Mini&#383;ter,) becau&#383;e &#383;uch is the
honourable conduct of our &#383;overeigns, that they pay their
&#383;pies in &#383;pecie&mdash;and their &#383;oldiers, and the
creditors of the &#383;tate, in paper.&mdash;Such is the morality,
&#383;uch the ju&#383;tice, &#383;uch are the republican virtues,
&#383;o loudly vaunted by our good and deare&#383;t friends, our
pen&#383;ioner&#383;&mdash;the Gazetteers of England and
Germany!"</p>
<p>There is not a &#383;ingle abu&#383;e, which the modern
reformers reprobated &#383;o loudly under the ancient
&#383;y&#383;tem, that is not magnified, in an infinite degree,
under the pre&#383;ent e&#383;tabli&#383;hment. For one Lettre de
Cachet i&#383;&#383;ued during the mild reign of LOUIS the
Sixteenth, a thou&#383;and Mandats d'Arret have been granted by the
tyrannical demagogues of the revolution; for one Ba&#383;tile which
exi&#383;ted under the Monarchy, a thou&#383;and Mai&#383;ons de
Detention have been e&#383;tabli&#383;hed by the Republic. In
&#383;hort, crimes of every denomination, and acts of tyranny and
inju&#383;tice, of every kind, have multiplied, &#383;ince the
abolition of royalty, in a proportion which &#383;et&#383; all the
powers of calculation at defiance.</p>
<p>It is &#383;carcely po&#383;&#383;ible to notice the
pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation of France, without adverting to the
circum&#383;tances of the WAR, and to the attempt now making,
through the medium of negotiation, to bring it to a &#383;peedy
conclu&#383;ion. Since the publication of my Letter to a Noble
Earl, now de&#383;tined to chew the cud of di&#383;appointment in
the vale of ob&#383;curity, I have been a&#383;toni&#383;hed to
hear the &#383;ame a&#383;&#383;ertions advance, by the
member&#383; and advocates of that party who&#383;e merit is
&#383;aid to con&#383;i&#383;t in the violence of their
oppo&#383;ition to the mea&#383;ures of government, on the origin
of the war, which had experienced the mo&#383;t ample confutation,
without the a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of any additional
rea&#383;on, and without the &#383;malle&#383;t attempt to
expo&#383;e the invalidity of tho&#383;e proofs which, in my
conception, amounted nearly to mathematical demon&#383;tration, and
which I had dared them, in terms the mo&#383;t pointed, to
invalidate. The que&#383;tion of aggre&#383;&#383;ion before
&#383;tood on &#383;uch high ground, that I had not the
pre&#383;umption to &#383;uppo&#383;e it could derive an
acce&#383;&#383;ion of &#383;trength from any arguments which I
could &#383;upply; but I was confident, that the authentic
documents which I offered to the public would remove every
intervening object that tended to ob&#383;truct the fight of
inattentive ob&#383;ervers, and reflect on it &#383;uch an
additional light as would fla&#383;h in&#383;tant conviction on the
minds of all. It &#383;eems, I have been deceived; but I mu&#383;t
be permitted to &#383;ugge&#383;t, that men who per&#383;i&#383;t
in the renewal of a&#383;&#383;ertions, without a &#383;ingle
effort to controvert the proofs which have been adduced to
demon&#383;trate their fallacy, cannot have for their object the
e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of truth&mdash;which ought,
exclu&#383;ively, to influence the conduct of public characters,
whether writers or orators.</p>
<p>With regard to the negotiation, I can derive not the
&#383;malle&#383;t hopes of &#383;ucce&#383;s from a contemplation
of the pa&#383;t conduct, or of the pre&#383;ent principles, of the
government of France. When I compare the projects of aggrandizement
openly avowed by the French rulers, previous to the declaration of
war again&#383;t this country, with the exorbitant
preten&#383;ion&#383; advanced in the arrogant reply of the
Executive Directory to the note pre&#383;ented by the Briti&#383;h
Envoy at Ba&#383;il in the month of February, 1796, and with the
more recent ob&#383;ervations contained in their official note of
the 19th of September la&#383;t, I cannot think it probable that
they will accede to any terms of peace that are compatible with the
intere&#383;t and &#383;afety of the Allies. Their object is not
&#383;o much the e&#383;tabli&#383;hment a&#383; the exten&#383;ion
of their republic.</p>
<p>As to the danger to be incurred by a treaty of peace with the
republic of France, though it has been con&#383;iderably
dimini&#383;hed by the events of the war, it is &#383;till
unque&#383;tionably great. This danger principally ari&#383;e&#383;
from a pertinacious adherence, on the part of the Directory, to
tho&#383;e very principles which were adopted by the original
promoters of the abolition of Monarchy in France. No greater proof
of &#383;uch adherence need be required than their refu&#383;al to
repeal tho&#383;e obnoxious decrees (pa&#383;&#383;ed in the months
of November and December, 1792,) which created &#383;o general and
&#383;o ju&#383;t an alarm throughout Europe, and which excited the
reprobation even of that party in England, which was willing to
admit the equivocal interpretation given to them by the Executive
Council of the day. I proved, in the Letter to a Noble Earl before
alluded to, from the very te&#383;timony of the members of that
Council them&#383;elves, as exhibited in their official
in&#383;tructions to one of their confidential agents, that the
interpretation which they had a&#383;&#383;igned to tho&#383;e
decrees, in their communications with the Briti&#383;h
Mini&#383;try, was a ba&#383;e interpretation, and that they really
intended to enforce the decrees, to the utmo&#383;t extent of their
po&#383;&#383;ible operation, and, by a literal con&#383;truction
thereof, to encourage rebellion in every &#383;tate, within the
reach of their arms or their principles. Nor have the pre&#383;ent
government merely forborne to repeal tho&#383;e de&#383;tructive
law&#383;&mdash;they have imitated the conduct of their
predece&#383;&#383;ors, have actually put them in execution
wherever they had the ability to do &#383;o, and have, in all
re&#383;pects, as far as related to tho&#383;e decrees, adopted the
preci&#383;e &#383;pirit and principles of the faction which
declared war again&#383;t England. Let any man read the
in&#383;tructions of the Executive Council to PUBLICOLA CHAUSSARD,
their Commi&#383;&#383;ary in the Netherlands, in 1792 and 1793,
and an account of the proceedings in the Low Countries
con&#383;equent thereon, and then examine the conduct of the
republican General, BOUNAPARTE, in Italy&mdash;who mu&#383;t
nece&#383;&#383;arily act from the in&#383;tructions of the
Executive Directory&mdash;&mdash;and he will be compelled to
acknowledge the ju&#383;tice of my remark, and to admit that the
latter actuated by the &#383;ame pernicious de&#383;ire to overturn
the &#383;ettled order of &#383;ociety, which invariably marked the
conduct of the former.</p>
<p>"It is an acknowledged fact, that every revolution requires a
provi&#383;ional power to regulate its di&#383;organizing
movements, and to direct the methodical demolition of every part of
the ancient &#383;ocial con&#383;titution.&mdash; Such ought to be
the revolutionary power.</p>
<p>"To whom can &#383;uch power belong, but to the French, in
tho&#383;e countrie&#383; into which they may carry their arms? Can
they with &#383;afety &#383;uffer it to be exerci&#383;ed by any
other per&#383;ons? It becomes the French republic, then, to
a&#383;&#383;ume this kind of guardian&#383;hip over the people
whom &#383;he awakens to Liberty!*"</p>

<p>Such were the Lacedaemonian principles avowed by the French
government in 1792, and &#383;uch is the Lacedaimonian policy*
pur&#383;ued by the French government in 1796! It cannot then, I
conceive, be contended, that a treaty with a government &#383;till
profe&#383;&#383;ing principles which have been repeatedly proved
to be &#383;ubver&#383;ive of all &#383;ocial order, which have
been acknowledged by their parents to have for their object the
methodical demolition of exi&#383;ting con&#383;titutions, can be
concluded without danger or ri&#383;k. That danger, I admit, is
greatly dimini&#383;hed, becau&#383;e the power which was
de&#383;tined to carry into execution tho&#383;e gigantic projects
which con&#383;tituted its object, has, by the operations of the
war, been con&#383;iderably curtailed. They well may exi&#383;t in
equal force, but the ability is no longer the &#383;ame.</p>
<p>MACHIAVEL ju&#383;tly ob&#383;erves, that it was the narrow
policy of the Lacedaemonians always to de&#383;troy the ancient
con&#383;titution, and e&#383;tabli&#383;h their own form of
government, in the counties and cities which they &#383;ubdued.</p>
<p>But though I maintain the exi&#383;tence of danger in a Treaty
with the Republic of France, unle&#383;s &#383;he previou&#383;ly
repeal the decrees to which I have adverted, and abrogate the acts
to which they have given birth, I by no means contend that it
exi&#383;ts in &#383;uch a degree as to ju&#383;tify a
determination, on the part of the Briti&#383;h government, to make
its removal the &#383;ine qua non of negotiation, or peace. Greatly
as I admire the brilliant endowments of Mr. BURKE, and highly as I
re&#383;pect and e&#383;teem him for the manly and deci&#383;ive
part which he has taken, in oppo&#383;ition to the de&#383;tructive
anarchy of republican France, and in defence of the
con&#383;titutional freedom of Britain; I cannot either agree with
him on thi&#383; point, or concur with him in the idea that the
re&#383;toration of the Monarchy of France was ever the object of
the war. That the Briti&#383;h Mini&#383;ters ardently de&#383;ired
that event, and were earne&#383;t in their endeavours to promote
it, is certain; not becau&#383;e it was the object of the war, but
becau&#383;e they con&#383;idered it as the be&#383;t means of
promoting the object of the war, which was, and is, the
e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of the &#383;afety and tranquillity of
Europe, on a &#383;olid and permanent ba&#383;is. If that object
can be attained, and the republic exi&#383;t, there is nothing in
the pa&#383;t conduct and profe&#383;&#383;ions of the Briti&#383;h
Mini&#383;ters, that can interpo&#383;e an ob&#383;tacle to the
conclu&#383;ion of peace. Indeed, in my apprehen&#383;ion, it would
be highly impolitic in any Mini&#383;ter, at the commencement of a
war, to advance any &#383;pecific object, that attainment of which
&#383;hould be declared to be the &#383;ine qua non of peace. If
mortals could arrogate to them&#383;elves the attributes of the
Deity, if they could direct the cour&#383;e of events, and controul
the chances of war, &#383;uch conduct would be ju&#383;tifiable;
but on no other principle, I think, can its defence be undertaken.
It is, I grant, much to be lamented, that the protection offered to
the friends of monarchy in France, by the declaration of the 29th
of October, 1793, could not be rendered effectual: as far as the
offer went it was certainly obligatory on the party who made it;
but it was merely conditional&mdash;re&#383;tricted, as all
&#383;imilar offers nece&#383;&#383;arily mu&#383;t be, by the
ability to fulfil the obligation incurred.</p>
<p>In paying this tribute to truth, it is not my intention to
retract, in the &#383;malle&#383;t degree, the opinion I have ever
profe&#383;&#383;ed, that the re&#383;toration of the ancient
monarchy of France would be the be&#383;t po&#383;&#383;ible means
not only of &#383;ecuring the different &#383;tates of Europe from
the dangers of republican anarchy, but of promoting the real
intere&#383;ts, welfare, and happine&#383;s of the French people
them&#383;elves. The rea&#383;ons on which this opinion is founded
I have long &#383;ince explained; and the intelligence which I have
&#383;ince received from France, at different times, has convinced
me that a very great proportion of her inhabitants concur in the
&#383;entiment.</p>
<p>The mi&#383;eries re&#383;ulting from the
e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of a republican &#383;y&#383;tem of
government have been &#383;everely felt, and deeply deplored; and I
am fully per&#383;uaded, that the &#383;ubjects and tributaries of
France will cordially &#383;ub&#383;cribe to the following
ob&#383;ervation on republican freedom, advanced by a writer who
had deeply &#383;tudied the genius of republics: <i>"Di tutte le
fervitu dure, quella e duri&#383;&#383;ima, che ti &#383;ottomette
ad una republica; l'una, perche e la piu durabile, e manco &#383;i
puo &#383;perarne d'ufare: L'altra perche il fine della republica e
enervare ed indebolire, debolire, per accre&#383;cere il corpo
&#383;uo, tutti gli altri corpi.</i>*"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>P.S. Since I wrote the preceding remarks, I have been given to
under&#383;tand, that by a decree, &#383;ub&#383;equent to the
completion of the con&#383;titutional code, the fir&#383;t partial
renewal of the Executive Directory was deferred till the month of
March, 1979; and that, therefore, in thi&#383; in&#383;tance, the
pre&#383;ent Directory cannot be accu&#383;ed of having violated
the con&#383;titution. But the guilt is only to be tran&#383;ferred
from the Directory to the Convention, who pa&#383;&#383;ed that
decree, as well as &#383;ome others, in contradiction to a
po&#383;itive con&#383;titutional law.&mdash;&mdash;-Indeed, the
Directory them&#383;elves betrayed no greater delicacy with regard
to the ob&#383;ervance of the con&#383;titution, or M. BARRAS would
never have taken his &#383;eat among them; for the
con&#383;titution expre&#383;&#383;ly &#383;ays, (and this
po&#383;itive provi&#383;ion was not even modified by any
&#383;ub&#383;equent mandate of the Convention,) that no man
&#383;hall be elected a member of the Directory who has not
completed his fortieth year&mdash;whereas it is notorious that
Barras had not thi&#383; requi&#383;ite qualification, having been
born in the year 1758!</p>
<hr />
<p>I avail my&#383;elf of the opportunity afforded me by the
publication of a Second Edition to notice &#383;ome
in&#383;inuations which have been thrown out, tending to
que&#383;tion the authenticity of the work. The motives which have
induced the author to withhold from the&#383;e Letters the
&#383;anction of her name, relate not to her&#383;elf, but to
&#383;ome friends &#383;till remaining in France, who&#383;e
&#383;afety &#383;he ju&#383;tly conceives might be affected by the
di&#383;clo&#383;ure. Acceding to the force and propriety of
the&#383;e motives, yet aware of the &#383;u&#383;picions to which
a recital of important facts, by an anonymous writer, would
naturally be expo&#383;ed, and &#383;en&#383;ible, al&#383;o, that
a certain de&#383;cription of critics would gladly avail
them&#383;elves of any opportunity for di&#383;couraging the
circulation of a work which contained principles ho&#383;tile to
their own; I determined to prefix my name to the publication. By
&#383;o doing, I conceived that I &#383;tood pledged for it&#383;
authenticity; and the matter has certainly been put in a proper
light by an able and re&#383;pectable critic, who has ob&#383;erved
that "Mr. GIFFORD &#383;tand&#383; between the writer and the
public," and that "his name and character are the guarantees for
the authenticity of the Letters."</p>
<p>This is preci&#383;ely the &#383;ituation in which I meant to
place my&#383;elf&mdash; preci&#383;ely the pledge which I meant to
give. The Letters are exactly what they profe&#383;s to be; the
production of a Lady's pen, and written in the very &#383;ituations
which they de&#383;cribe.&mdash;The public can have no grounds for
&#383;u&#383;pecting my veracity on a point in which I can have no
po&#383;&#383;ible intere&#383;t in deceiving them; and tho&#383;e
who know me will do me the ju&#383;tice to acknowledge, that I have
a mind &#383;uperior to the arts of deception, and that I am
incapable of &#383;anctioning an impo&#383;ition, for any
purpo&#383;e, or from any motives whatever. Thus much I deemed it
nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;ay, a&#383; well from a regard for my
own character, and from a due attention to the public, as from a
wi&#383;h to prevent the circulation of the work from being
&#383;ubjected to the impediments ari&#383;ing from the prevalence
of a groundle&#383;&#383; &#383;u&#383;picion.</p>
<p>I naturally expected, that &#383;ome of the preceding remarks
would excite the re&#383;entment and draw down the vengeance of
tho&#383;e per&#383;ons to whom they evidently applied. The
contents of every publication are certainly a fair &#383;ubject for
critici&#383;m; and to the fair comments of real critics, however
repugnant to the &#383;entiments I entertain, or the doctrine I
&#383;eek to inculcate, I &#383;hall ever &#383;ubmit without
murmur or reproach. But, when men, a&#383;&#383;uming that
re&#383;pectable office, openly violate all the dutie&#383;
attached to it, and, &#383;inking the critic in the partizan, make
a wanton attack on my veracity, it becomes proper to repel the
injuriou&#383; imputation; and the &#383;ame &#383;pirit which
dictates &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to the candid award of an
impartial judge, pre&#383;cribes indignation and &#383;corn at the
cowardly attacks of a &#383;ecret a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in.</p>

<p>It is with extreme diffidence that I offer the following pages

<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>After having, more than once, in the following Letters,
expre&#383;&#383;ed opinions decidedly unfavourable to female
author&#383;hip, when not ju&#383;tified by &#383;uperior talents,
I may, by now producing them to the public, &#383;ubject
my&#383;elf to the imputation either of vanity or
incon&#383;i&#383;tency; and I acknowledge that a great &#383;hare
of candour and indulgence mu&#383;t be
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed by readers who attend to the
apologies u&#383;ually made on &#383;uch occa&#383;ions: yet I may
with the &#383;tricte&#383;t truth alledge, that I &#383;hould
never have ventured to offer any production of mine to the world,
had I not conceived it po&#383;&#383;ible that information and
reflections collected and made on the &#383;pot, during a period
when France exhibited a &#383;tate, of which there is no example in
the annals of mankind, might gratify curio&#383;ity without the aid
of literary embelli&#383;hment; and an adherence to truth, I
flattered my&#383;elf, might, on a &#383;ubject of this nature, be
more acceptable than brilliancy of thought, or elegance of
language. The eruption of a volcano may be more &#383;cientifically
de&#383;cribed and accounted for by the philo&#383;opher; but the
relation of the illiterate pea&#383;ant who beheld it, and
&#383;uffered from its effects, may not be le&#383;s
intere&#383;ting to the common hearer.</p>
<p>Above all, I was actuated by the de&#383;ire of conveying to my
countrymen a ju&#383;t idea of that revolution which they have been
incited to imitate, and of that government by which it has been
propo&#383;ed to model our own.</p>
<p>Since the&#383;e pages were written, the Convention has
nominally been di&#383;&#383;olved, and a new con&#383;titution and
government have &#383;ucceeded, but no real change of principle or
actors has taken place; and the &#383;y&#383;tem, of which I have
endeavoured to trace the progre&#383;s, mu&#383;t &#383;till be
con&#383;idered as exi&#383;ting, with no other variations than
&#383;uch as have been nece&#383;&#383;arily produced by the
difference of time and circum&#383;tances. The people grew tired of
ma&#383;&#383;acres en ma&#383;&#383;e, and executions en detail:
even the national ficklene&#383;s operated in favour of humanity;
and it was al&#383;o di&#383;covered, that however a &#383;pirit of
royali&#383;m might be &#383;ubdued to temporary inaction, it was
not to be eradicated, and that the &#383;ufferings of its martyrs
only tended to propagate and confirm it. Hence the &#383;caffolds
flow le&#383;&#383; frequently with blood, and the barbarous
prudence of CAMILLE DESMOULINS' guillotine economique has been
adopted. But exaction and oppre&#383;&#383;ion are &#383;till
practi&#383;ed in every &#383;hape, and ju&#383;tice is not
le&#383;s violated, nor i&#383; property more &#383;ecure, than
when the former was admini&#383;tered by revolutionary tribunals,
and the latter was at the di&#383;po&#383;ition of revolutionary
armies.</p>
<p>The error of &#383;uppo&#383;ing that the various parties which
have u&#383;urped the government of France have differed
e&#383;&#383;entially from each other is pretty general; and it is
common enough to hear the revolutionary tyranny exclu&#383;ively
a&#383;&#383;ociated with the per&#383;on of ROBESPIERRE, and the
thirty-fir&#383;t of May, 1793, con&#383;idered as the epoch of its
introduction. Yet whoever examines attentively the &#383;ituation
and politics of France, from the &#383;ubver&#383;ion of the
Monarchy, will be convinced that all the principles of this
mon&#383;trous government were e&#383;tabli&#383;hed during the
admini&#383;tration of the Bri&#383;&#383;otins, and that the
factions which &#383;ucceeded, from Danton and Robe&#383;pierre to
Sieyes and Barras, have only developed them, and reduced them to
practice. The revolution of the thirty-fir&#383;t of May, 1793, was
not a conte&#383;t for &#383;y&#383;tem but for power&mdash;that of
July the twenty-eighth, 1794, (9th Thermidor,) was merely a
&#383;truggle which of two parties &#383;hould &#383;acrifice the
other&mdash;that of October the fifth, 1795, (13th Vendemiaire,) a
war of the government again&#383;t the people. But in all
the&#383;e convul&#383;ions, the primitive doctrines of tyranny and
inju&#383;tice were watched like the &#383;acred fire, and have
never for a moment been &#383;uffered to langui&#383;h.</p>
<p>It may appear incredible to tho&#383;e who have not
per&#383;onally witne&#383;&#383;ed thi&#383; phoenomenon, that a
government dete&#383;ted and de&#383;pi&#383;ed by an immen&#383;e
majority of the nation, &#383;hould have been able not only to
re&#383;i&#383;t the efforts of &#383;o many powers combined
again&#383;t it, but even to proceed from defence to conque&#383;t,
and to mingle &#383;urprize and terror with tho&#383;e
&#383;entiments of contempt and abhorrence which it originally
excited.</p>
<p>That wi&#383;dom or talents are not the &#383;ources of this
&#383;ucce&#383;s, may be deduced from the &#383;ituation of France
it&#383;elf. The armies of the republic have, indeed, invaded the
territories of its enemies, but the de&#383;olation of their own
country &#383;eems to increa&#383;e with every triumph&mdash;the
genius of the French government appears powerful only in
de&#383;truction, and inventive only in
oppre&#383;&#383;ion&mdash;and, while it is endowed with the
faculty of &#383;preading univer&#383;al ruin, it is incapable of
promoting the happine&#383;s of the &#383;malle&#383;t
di&#383;trict under its protection. The unre&#383;trained pillage
of the conquered countries has not &#383;aved France from
multiplied bankruptcies, nor her &#383;tate-creditors from dying
through want; and the French, in the mid&#383;t of their external
pro&#383;perity, are often di&#383;tingui&#383;hed from the people
whom their armies have been &#383;ubjugated, only by a
&#383;uperior degree of wretchedne&#383;s, and a more irregular
de&#383;poti&#383;m.</p>
<p>With a power exce&#383;&#383;ive and unlimited, and
&#383;urpa&#383;&#383;ing what has hitherto been
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed by any Sovereign, it would be
difficult to prove that the&#383;e democratic de&#383;pots have
effected any thing either u&#383;eful or beneficent. Whatever has
the appearance of being &#383;o will be found, on examination, to
have for its object &#383;ome purpo&#383;e of individual
intere&#383;t or per&#383;onal vanity. They manage the armies, they
embelli&#383;h Paris, they purcha&#383;e the friend&#383;hip of
&#383;ome &#383;tates and the neutrality of others; but if there be
any real patriots in France, how little do they appreciate
the&#383;e u&#383;ele&#383;s triumphs, the&#383;e pilfered
mu&#383;eums, and the&#383;e fallaciou&#383; negotiations, when
they behold the population of their country dimini&#383;hed, its
commerce annihilated, its wealth di&#383;&#383;ipated, its
moral&#383; corrupted, and its liberty de&#383;troyed&mdash;</p>

<p>The operations of all other governments mu&#383;t, in a great
mea&#383;ure, be re&#383;trained by the will of the people, and by
e&#383;tabli&#383;hed laws; with them, phy&#383;ical and political
force are nece&#383;&#383;arily &#383;eparate con&#383;iderations:
they have not only to calculate what can be borne, but what will be
&#383;ubmitted to; and perhaps France is the fir&#383;t country
that has been compelled to an exertion of its whole &#383;trength,
without regard to any ob&#383;tacle, natural, moral, or divine. It
is for want of &#383;ufficiently inve&#383;tigating and allowing
for this moral and political latitudinariani&#383;m of our enemies,
that we are apt to be too precipitate in cen&#383;uring the conduct
of the war; and, in our e&#383;timation of what has been done, we
pay too little regard to the principles by which we have been
directed. An hone&#383;t man could &#383;carcely imagine the means
we have had to oppo&#383;e, and an Engli&#383;hman &#383;till
le&#383;s conceive that they would have been &#383;ubmitted to: for
the &#383;ame rea&#383;on that the Romans had no law again&#383;t
parricide, till experience had evinced the po&#383;&#383;ibility of
the crime.</p>
<p>In a war like the pre&#383;ent, advantage is not altogether to
be appreciated by military &#383;uperiority. If, as there is
ju&#383;t ground for believing, our external ho&#383;tilities have
averted an internal revolution, what we have e&#383;caped is of
infinitely more importance to us than what we could acquire.
Commerce and conque&#383;t, compared to this, are &#383;econdary
objects; and the pre&#383;ervation of our liberties and our
con&#383;titution is a more &#383;olid ble&#383;&#383;ing than the
commerce of both the Indies, or the conque&#383;t of nations.</p>
<p>Should the following pages contribute to impre&#383;s this
&#383;alutary truth on my countrymen, my utmo&#383;t ambition will
be gratified; per&#383;uaded, that a &#383;en&#383;e of the
mi&#383;eries they have avoided, and of the happine&#383;s they
enjoy, will be their be&#383;t incentive, whether they may have to
oppo&#383;e the arms of the enemy in a continuance of the war, or
their more dangerou&#383; machinations on the re&#383;toration of
peace.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude without noticing my obligations to the
Gentleman who&#383;e name is prefixed to the&#383;e volumes; and I
think it at the &#383;ame time incumbent on me to avow, that, in
having a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted the author, he mu&#383;t not be
con&#383;idered as &#383;anctioning the literary imperfections of
the work. When the &#383;ubject was fir&#383;t mentioned to him, he
did me the ju&#383;tice of &#383;uppo&#383;ing, that I was not
likely to have written any thing, the general tendency of which he
might di&#383;approve; and when, on peru&#383;ing the
manu&#383;cript, he found it contain &#383;entiments
di&#383;&#383;imilar to his own, he wa&#383; too liberal to require
a &#383;acrifice of them as the condition of hi&#383;
&#383;ervices.&mdash;I confe&#383;s that previous to my arrival in
France in 1792, I entertained opinions &#383;omewhat more
favourable to the principle of the revolution than tho&#383;e which
I was led to adopt at a &#383;ub&#383;equent period.
Accu&#383;tomed to regard with great ju&#383;tice the Briti&#383;h
con&#383;titution as the &#383;tandard of known political
excellence, I hardly conceived it po&#383;&#383;ible that freedom
or happine&#383;s could exi&#383;t under any other: and I am not
&#383;ingular in having &#383;uffered this
prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion to invalidate even the evidence
of my &#383;en&#383;es. I was, therefore, naturally partial to
whatever profe&#383;&#383;ed to approach the object of my
veneration. I forgot that governments are not to be founded on
imitations or theories, and that they are perfect only as adapted
to the genius, manners, and di&#383;po&#383;ition of the people who
are &#383;ubject to them. Experience and maturer judgement have
corrected my error, and I am perfectly convinced, that the old
monarchical con&#383;titution of France, with very &#383;light
meliorations, wa&#383; every way better calculated for the national
character than a more popular form of government.</p>
<p>A critic, though not very &#383;evere, will di&#383;cover many
faults of &#383;tyle, even where the matter may not be
exceptionable. Be&#383;ides my other deficiencies, the habit of
writing is not ea&#383;ily &#383;upplied, and, as I de&#383;paired
of attaining excellence, and was not &#383;olicitous about
degree&#383; of mediocrity, I determined on conveying to the public
&#383;uch information as I was po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of,
without alteration or ornament. Mo&#383;t of the&#383;e Letters
were written exactly in the &#383;ituation they de&#383;cribe, and
remain in their original &#383;tate; the re&#383;t were arranged
according a&#383; opportunities were favourable, from notes and
diaries kept when "the times were hot and feveri&#383;h," and when
it would have been dangerous to attempt more method. I forbear to
de&#383;cribe how they were concealed either in France or at my
departure, becau&#383;e I might give ri&#383;e to the
per&#383;ecution and oppre&#383;&#383;ion of others. But, that I
may not attribute to my&#383;elf courage which I do not
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s, nor create doubts of my veracity, I
mu&#383;t ob&#383;erve, that I &#383;eldom ventured to write till I
was a&#383;&#383;ured of &#383;ome certain means of conveying my
papers to a per&#383;on who could &#383;afely di&#383;po&#383;e of
them.</p>
<p>As a con&#383;iderable period has elap&#383;ed &#383;ince my
return, it may not be improper to add, that I took &#383;ome
&#383;teps for the publication of the&#383;e Letters &#383;o early
as July, 1795. Certain difficulties, however, ari&#383;ing, of
which I was not aware, I relinqui&#383;hed my de&#383;ign, and
&#383;hould not have been tempted to re&#383;ume it, but for the
kindne&#383;s of the Gentleman who&#383;e name appears as the
Editor.</p>

<h2>May 10, 1792.</h2>
<p>I am every day more confirmed in the opinion I communicated to
you on my arrival, that the fir&#383;t ardour of the revolution is
abated.&mdash;The bridal days are indeed pa&#383;t, and I think I
perceive &#383;omething like indifference approaching. Perhaps the
French them&#383;elves are not &#383;en&#383;ible of thi&#383;
change; but I who have been ab&#383;ent two years, and have made as
it were a &#383;udden tran&#383;ition from enthu&#383;ia&#383;m to
coldne&#383;s, without pa&#383;&#383;ing through the intermediate
gradations, am forcibly &#383;truck with it. When I was here in
1790, parties could be &#383;carcely &#383;aid to
exi&#383;t&mdash;the popular triumph wa&#383; too complete and too
recent for intolerance and per&#383;ecution, and the
Noble&#383;&#383;e and Clergy either &#383;ubmitted in
&#383;ilence, or appeared to rejoice in their own defeat. In fact,
it was the confu&#383;ion of a deci&#383;ive
conque&#383;t&mdash;the victors and the vanqui&#383;hed were
mingled together; and the one had not lei&#383;ure to exerci&#383;e
cruelty, nor the other to meditate revenge. Politics had not yet
divided &#383;ociety; nor the weakne&#383;s and pride of the great,
with the malice and in&#383;olence of the little, thinned the
public places. The politics of the women went no farther than a few
couplets in prai&#383;e of liberty, and the patrioti&#383;m of the
men was confined to an habit de garde nationale, the device of a
button, or a nocturnal revel, which they called mounting
guard.&mdash;Money was yet plenty, at lea&#383;t &#383;ilver, (for
the gold had already begun to di&#383;appear,) commerce in it&#383;
u&#383;ual train, and, in &#383;hort, to one who ob&#383;erves no
deeper than my&#383;elf, every thing &#383;eemed gay and
flouri&#383;hing&mdash;the people were per&#383;uaded they were
happier; and, amid&#383;t &#383;uch an appearance of content, one
mu&#383;t have been a cold politician to have examined too
&#383;trictly into the future. But all this, my good brother, is in
a great mea&#383;ure &#383;ub&#383;ided; and the di&#383;parity is
&#383;o evident, that I almo&#383;t imagine my&#383;elf one of the
&#383;even &#383;leeper&#383;&mdash;and, like them too, the coin I
offer is become rare, and regarded more as medals than money. The
playful di&#383;tinctions of Ari&#383;tocrate and Democrate are
degenerated into the opprobium and bitterne&#383;s of
Party&mdash;political di&#383;&#383;en&#383;ions pervade and chill
the common intercour&#383;e of life&mdash;the people are become
gro&#383;s and arbitrary, and the higher cla&#383;&#383;es (from a
pride which tho&#383;e who con&#383;ider the frailty of human
nature will allow for) de&#383;ert the public amu&#383;ements,
where they cannot appear but at the ri&#383;k of being the marked
objects of in&#383;ult.&mdash;The politics of the women are no
longer innoxiou&#383;&mdash;their political principle&#383; form
the leading trait of their characters; and as you know we are often
apt to &#383;upply by zeal what we want in power, the ladies are
far from being the mo&#383;t tolerant partizans on either
&#383;ide.&mdash;The national uniform, which contributed &#383;o
much to the &#383;ucce&#383;s of the revolution, and
&#383;timulated the patrioti&#383;m of the young men, is become
general; and the ta&#383;k of mounting guard, to which it
&#383;ubjects the wearer, is now a &#383;eriou&#383; and
trouble&#383;ome duty.&mdash;To fini&#383;h my ob&#383;ervations,
and my contra&#383;t, no Specie whatever is to be &#383;een; and
the people, if they &#383;till idolize their new form of
government, do it at pre&#383;ent with great
&#383;obriety&mdash;the Vive la nation! &#383;eems now rather the
effect of habit than of feeling; and one &#383;eldom hears any
thing like the &#383;pontaneous and enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic
&#383;ounds I formerly remarked.</p>
<p>I have not yet been here long enough to di&#383;cover the
cau&#383;es of thi&#383; change; perhaps they may lie too deep for
&#383;uch an ob&#383;erver as my&#383;elf: but if (as the
cau&#383;es of important effects &#383;ometimes do) they lie on the
&#383;urface, they will be le&#383;s liable to e&#383;cape me, than
an ob&#383;erver of more pretentions. Whatever my remarks are, I
will not fail to communicate them&mdash;the employment will at
lea&#383;t be agreeable to me, though the re&#383;ult &#383;hould
not be &#383;ati&#383;factory to you; and as I &#383;hall never
venture on any reflection, without relating the occurrence that
gave ri&#383;e to it, your own judgement will enable you to correct
the errors of mine.</p>
<p>I was pre&#383;ent ye&#383;terday at a funeral &#383;ervice,
performed in honour of General Dillon. This kind of &#383;ervice is
common in Catholic countries, and con&#383;i&#383;ts in erecting a
cenotaph, ornamented with numerous lights, flowers,
cro&#383;&#383;es, &amp;c. The church is hung with black, and the
ma&#383;s i&#383; performed the &#383;ame as if the body were
pre&#383;ent. On account of General Dillon's profe&#383;&#383;ion,
the ma&#383;s ye&#383;terday was a military one. It mu&#383;t
always, I imagine, &#383;ound &#383;trange to the ears of a
Prote&#383;tant, to hear nothing but theatrical mu&#383;ic on
the&#383;e occa&#383;ions, and indeed I could never reconcile
my&#383;elf to it; for if we allow any effect to mu&#383;ic at all,
the train of thought which &#383;hould in&#383;pire us with
re&#383;pect for the dead, and reflections on mortality, is not
likely to be produced by the &#383;trains in which Dido bewails
Eneas, or in which Armida a&#383;&#383;ails the virtue of
Rinaldo.&mdash;I fear, that in general the air of an opera reminds
the belle of the Theatre where &#383;he heard it&mdash;and, by a
natural tran&#383;ition, of the beau who attended her, and the
dre&#383;s of her&#383;elf and her neighbours. I confe&#383;s, this
was nearly my own ca&#383;e ye&#383;terday, on hearing an air from
"Sargines;" and had not the funeral oration reminded me, I
&#383;hould have forgotten the unfortunate event we were
celebrating, and which, for &#383;ome days before, when
undi&#383;tracted by this pious ceremony, I had dwelt on with pity
and horror.*&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>* At the fir&#383;t &#383;kirmi&#383;h between the
French and Au&#383;trians near Li&#383;le, a general panic
&#383;eized the former, and they retreated in di&#383;order to
Li&#383;le, crying _"Sauve qui peut, &amp; nous fomnes (&#383;ic)
trahis."_--"Let every one &#383;hift for him&#383;elf&mdash;we are

was ma&#383;&#383;acred at his return on the great
&#383;quare.&mdash;My pen faulters, and refu&#383;es to
de&#383;cribe the barbarities committed on the lifele&#383;s hero.
Let it &#383;uffice, perhap&#383; more than &#383;uffice, to
&#383;ay, that his mutilated remains were thrown on a fire, which
the&#383;e &#383;avages danced round, with yells
expre&#383;&#383;ive of their execrable fe&#383;tivity. A young
Engli&#383;hman, who was &#383;o unfortunate as to be near the
&#383;pot, was compelled to join in thi&#383; outrage to
humanity.&mdash;The &#383;ame day a gentleman, the intimate friend
of our acquaintance, Mad. _____, was walking (uncon&#383;cious what
had happened) without the gate which leads to Douay, and was met by
the flying ruffians on their return; immediately on &#383;eeing him
they &#383;houted, <i>"Voila encore un Ari&#383;tocrate!"</i> and
ma&#383;&#383;acred him on the &#383;pot.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Independent of any regret for the fate of Dillon, who is
&#383;aid to have been a brave and good officer, I am &#383;orry
that the fir&#383;t event of thi&#383; war &#383;hould be marked by
cruelty and licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s.&mdash;Military
di&#383;cipline has been much relaxed &#383;ince the revolution,
and from the length of time &#383;ince the French have been engaged
in a land war, many of the troops mu&#383;t be without that kind of
courage which is the effect of habit. The danger, therefore, of
&#383;uffering them to alledge that they are betrayed, whenever
they do not choo&#383;e to fight, and to excu&#383;e their own
cowardice by a&#383;cribing treachery to their leaders, is
incalculable.&mdash;Above all, every infraction of the laws in a
country ju&#383;t &#383;uppo&#383;ing it&#383;elf become free,
cannot be too &#383;everely repre&#383;&#383;ed. The National
A&#383;&#383;embly have done all that humanity could
&#383;ugge&#383;t&mdash;they have ordered the puni&#383;hment of
the a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins, and have pen&#383;ioned and
adopted the General's children. The orator expatiated both on the
horror of the act and its con&#383;equences, a&#383; I &#383;hould
have thought, with &#383;ome ingenuity, had I not been
a&#383;&#383;ured by a brother orator that the whole was
"execrable." But I frequently remark, that though a Frenchman may
&#383;uppo&#383;e the merit of his countrymen to be collectively
&#383;uperior to that of the whole world, he &#383;eldom allows any
individual of them to have &#383;o large a portion as
him&#383;elf.&mdash;Adieu: I have already written enough to
convince you I have neither acquired the Gallomania, nor forgotten
my friends in England; and I conclude with a wi&#383;h <i>a
propo&#383;</i> to my &#383;ubject&mdash;that they may long enjoy
the rational liberty they po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s and &#383;o well
de&#383;erve.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>May, 1792.</h2>
<p>You, my dear _____, who live in a land of pounds,
&#383;hillings, and pence, can &#383;carcely form an idea of our
embarra&#383;&#383;ments through the want of them. 'Tis true,
the&#383;e are petty evils; but when you con&#383;ider that they
happen every day, and every hour, and that, if they are not very
&#383;erious, they are very frequent, you will rejoice in the
&#383;plendour of your national credit, which procures you all the
accommodation of paper currency, without dimini&#383;hing the
circulation of &#383;pecie. Our only currency here
con&#383;i&#383;ts of a&#383;&#383;ignats of 5 livres, 50, 100,
200, and upwards: therefore in making purcha&#383;es, you mu&#383;t
accommodate your wants to the value of your a&#383;&#383;ignat, or
you mu&#383;t owe the &#383;hopkeeper, or the &#383;hopkeeper
mu&#383;t owe you; and, in &#383;hort, as an old woman
a&#383;&#383;ured me to-day, "C'e&#383;t de quoi faire perdre la
tete," and, if it la&#383;ted long, it would be the death of her.
Within the&#383;e few days, however, the municipalities have
attempted to remedy the inconvenience, by creating &#383;mall paper
of five, ten, fifteen, and twenty &#383;ols, which they give in
exchange for a&#383;&#383;ignats of five livres; but the number
they are allowed to i&#383;&#383;ue is limited, and the demand for
them &#383;o great, that the accommodation is inadequate to the
difficulty of procuring it. On the days on which this paper (which
i&#383; called billets de confiance) is i&#383;&#383;ued, the Hotel
de Ville is be&#383;ieged by a ho&#383;t of women collected from
all parts of the di&#383;trict&mdash;Pea&#383;ants, &#383;mall
&#383;hopkeepers, fervant maids, and though la&#383;t, not
lea&#383;t formidable&mdash; fi&#383;hwomen. They u&#383;ually take
their &#383;tand two or three hours before the time of delivery,
and the interval is employed in di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing the news,
and execrating paper money. But when once the door is opened, a
&#383;cene takes place which bids defiance to language, and calls
for the pencil of a Hogarth. Babel was, I dare &#383;ay,
comparatively to this, a place of retreat and &#383;ilence.
Clamours, revilings, contentions, tearing of hair, and breaking of
heads, generally conclude the bu&#383;ine&#383;s; and, after the
lo&#383;s of half a day's time, &#383;ome part of their clothes,
and the expence of a few brui&#383;es, the combatants retire with
&#383;mall bills to the value of five, or perhaps ten livres, as
the whole re&#383;ource to carry on their little commerce for the
en&#383;uing week. I doubt not but the paper may have had &#383;ome
&#383;hare in alienating the minds of the people from the
revolution. Whenever I want to purcha&#383;e any thing, the vender
u&#383;ually an&#383;wers my que&#383;tion by another, and with a
rueful kind of tone inquires, "En papier, madame?"&mdash;and the
bargain concludes with a melancholy reflection on the hardne&#383;s
of the times.</p>
<p>The decrees relative to the prie&#383;ts have likewi&#383;e
occa&#383;ioned much di&#383;&#383;en&#383;ion; and it &#383;eems
to me impolitic thus to have made religion the &#383;tandard of
party. The high ma&#383;s, which is celebrated by a prie&#383;t who
has taken the oaths, is frequented by a numerous, but, it mu&#383;t
be confe&#383;&#383;ed, an ill-dre&#383;t and ill-&#383;cented
congregation; while the low ma&#383;s, which is later, and which is
allowed the nonjuring clergy, has a gayer audience, but is much
le&#383;s crouded.&mdash;By the way, I believe many who formerly
did not much di&#383;turb them&#383;elves about religious tenets,
have become rigid Papi&#383;ts &#383;ince an adherence to the holy
&#383;ee has become a criterion of political opinion. But if
the&#383;e &#383;eparati&#383;ts are bigoted and ob&#383;tinate,
the conventionali&#383;ts on their &#383;ide are ignorant and
intolerant.</p>
<p>I enquired my way to-day to the Rue de l'Hopital. The woman I
&#383;poke to a&#383;ked me, in a menacing tone, what I wanted
there. I replied, which wa&#383; true, that I merely wanted to
pa&#383;s through the &#383;treet as my neare&#383;t way home; upon
which &#383;he lowered her voice, and conducted me very
civilly.&mdash;I mentioned the circum&#383;tance on my return, and
found that the nuns of the ho&#383;pital had their ma&#383;s
performed by a prie&#383;t who had not taken the oaths, and that
tho&#383;e who were &#383;u&#383;pected of going to attend it were
in&#383;ulted, and &#383;ometimes ill treated. A poor woman,
&#383;ome little time ago, who conceived perhaps that her
&#383;alvation might depend on exerci&#383;ing her religion in the
way &#383;he had been accu&#383;tomed to, per&#383;i&#383;ted in
going, and was u&#383;ed by the populace with &#383;uch a mixture
of barbarity and indecency, that her life was de&#383;paired of.
Yet this is the age and the country of
Philo&#383;ophers.&mdash;Perhaps you will begin to think Swift's
&#383;ages, who only amu&#383;ed them&#383;elves with endeavouring
to propagate &#383;heep without wool, not &#383;o contemptible. I
am almo&#383;t convinced my&#383;elf, that when a man once piques
him&#383;elf on being a philo&#383;opher, if he does no
mi&#383;chief you ought to be &#383;ati&#383;fied with him.</p>
<p>We pa&#383;&#383;ed la&#383;t Sunday with Mr. de ____'s tenants
in the country. Nothing can equal the avidity of the&#383;e people
for news. We &#383;at down after dinner under &#383;ome trees in
the village, and Mr. de _____ began reading the Gazette to the
farmers who were about us. In a few minutes every thing that could
hear (for I leave under&#383;tanding the pedantry of a French
new&#383;paper out of the que&#383;tion) were his auditors. A party
at quoits in one field, and a dancing party in another, quitted
their amu&#383;ements, and li&#383;tened with undivided attention.
I believe in general the farmers are the people mo&#383;t contented
with the revolution, and indeed they have rea&#383;on to be
&#383;o; for at pre&#383;ent they refu&#383;e to &#383;ell their
corn unle&#383;s for money, while they pay their rent in
a&#383;&#383;ignats; and farms being for the mo&#383;t part on
lea&#383;es, the objections of the landlord to this kind of payment
are of no avail. Great encouragement is likewi&#383;e held out to
them to purcha&#383;e national property, which I am informed they
do to an extent that may for &#383;ome time be injurious to
agriculture; for in their eagerne&#383;s to acquire land, the
deprive them&#383;elves of cultivating it. They do not, like our
cru&#383;ading ance&#383;tors, "&#383;ell the pa&#383;ture to buy
the hor&#383;e," but the hor&#383;e to buy the pa&#383;ture;
&#383;o that we may expect to &#383;ee in many places large farms
in the hands of tho&#383;e who are obliged to neglect them.</p>
<p>A great change has happened within the la&#383;t year, with
regard to landed property&mdash;&#383;o much has been &#383;old,
that many farmers have had the opportunity of becoming proprietors.
The rage of emigration, which the approach of war, pride, timidity,
and vanity are daily increa&#383;ing, ha&#383; occa&#383;ioned many
of the Noble&#383;&#383;e to &#383;ell their e&#383;tates, which,
with tho&#383;e of the Crown and the Clergy, form a large ma&#383;s
of property, thrown as it were into general circulation. This may
in future be beneficial to the country, but the pre&#383;ent
generation will perhaps have to purcha&#383;e (and not cheaply)
advantages they cannot enjoy. A philanthropi&#383;t may not think
of this with regret; and yet I know not why one race is preferable
to another, or why an evil &#383;hould be endured by tho&#383;e who
exi&#383;t now, in order that tho&#383;e who &#383;ucceed may be
free from it.&mdash;I would willingly plant a million of acorns,
that another age might be &#383;upplied with oaks; but I
confe&#383;s, I do not think it quite &#383;o plea&#383;ant for us
to want bread, in order that our de&#383;cendants may have a
&#383;uperfluity.</p>
<p>I am half a&#383;hamed of the&#383;e &#383;elfi&#383;h
arguments; but really I have been led to them through mere
apprehen&#383;ion of what I fear the people may have yet to endure,
in con&#383;equence of the revolution.</p>
<p>I have frequently ob&#383;erved how little ta&#383;te the French
have for the country, and I believe all my companions, except Mr.
de _____, who took (as one always does) an intere&#383;t in
&#383;urveying his property, were heartily ennuyes with our little
excur&#383;ion.&mdash;Mad. De _____, on her arrival, took her
po&#383;t by the farmer's fire-&#383;ide, and was out of humour the
whole day, ina&#383;much as our fare was homely, and there was
nothing but ru&#383;tics to &#383;ee or be &#383;een by. That a
plain dinner &#383;hould be a &#383;erious affair, you may not
wonder; but the la&#383;t cau&#383;e of di&#383;tre&#383;s, perhaps
you will not conclude quite &#383;o natural at her years. All that
can be &#383;aid about it is, that &#383;he is a French woman, who
rouges, and wears lilac ribbons, at &#383;eventy-four. I hope, in
my zeal to obey you, my reflections will not be too
voluminous.&mdash;For the pre&#383;ent I will be warned by my
con&#383;cience, and add only, that I am, Yours.</p>

<h2>June 10, 1792.</h2>
<p>You ob&#383;erve, with &#383;ome &#383;urprize, that I make no
mention of the Jacobin&#383;&mdash; the fact is, that until now I
have heard very little about them. Your Engli&#383;h partizans of
the revolution have, by publi&#383;hing their corre&#383;pondence
with the&#383;e &#383;ocieties, attributed a con&#383;equence to
them infinitely beyond what they have had preten&#383;ions
to:&mdash;a prophet, it i&#383; &#383;aid, is not honoured in his
own country&mdash;I am &#383;ure a Jacobin is not. In provincial
towns the&#383;e clubs are generally compo&#383;ed of a few of the
lowe&#383;t trade&#383;men, who have &#383;o
di&#383;intere&#383;ted a patrioti&#383;m, as to be&#383;tow more
attention on the &#383;tate than on their own &#383;hops; and as a
man may be an excellent patriot without the ari&#383;tocratic
talents of reading and writing, they u&#383;ually provide a
&#383;ecretary or pre&#383;ident, who can &#383;upply the&#383;e
deficiencie&#383;&mdash;a country attorney, a <i>Pere de
l'oratoire,</i> or a di&#383;banded capuchin, is in mo&#383;t
places the candidate for this office. The clubs often
a&#383;&#383;emble only to read the new&#383;papers; but where they
are &#383;ufficiently in force, they make motions for "fetes,"
cen&#383;ure the municipalities, and endeavour to influence the
elections of the member&#383; who compo&#383;e them.&mdash;That of
Paris is &#383;uppo&#383;ed to con&#383;i&#383;t of about &#383;ix
thou&#383;and members; but I am told their number and influence are
daily increa&#383;ing, and that the National A&#383;&#383;embly is
more &#383;ub&#383;ervient to them than it is willing to
acknowledge&mdash;yet, I believe, the people at large are equally
adver&#383;e to the Jacobins, who are &#383;aid to entertain the
chimerical project of forming a republic, and to the
Ari&#383;tocrates, who wi&#383;h to re&#383;tore the ancient
government. The party in oppo&#383;ition to both the&#383;e, who
are called the Feuillans,* have the real voice of the people with
them, and knowing this, they employ le&#383;s art than their
opponents, have no point of union, and perhaps may finally be
undermined by intrigue, or even &#383;ubdued by violence.</p>

<p>You &#383;eem not to comprehend why I include vanity among the
cau&#383;es of emigration, and yet I a&#383;&#383;ure you it has
had no &#383;mall &#383;hare in many of them. The gentry of the
provinces, by thus imitating the higher noble&#383;&#383;e, imagine
they have formed a kind of a common cau&#383;e, which may hereafter
tend to equalize the difference of ranks, and a&#383;&#383;ociate
them with tho&#383;e they have been accu&#383;tomed to look up to
as their &#383;uperiors. It is a kind of ton among the women,
particularly to talk of their emigrated relations, with an accent
more expre&#383;&#383;ive of pride than regret, and which
&#383;eems to lay claim to di&#383;tinction rather than pity.</p>

<h2>June 24, 1792.</h2>
<p>You have doubtle&#383;s learned from the public papers the late
outrage of the Jacobins, in order to force the King to con&#383;ent
to the formation of an army at Paris, and to &#383;ign the decree
for bani&#383;hing the nonjuring Clergy. The new&#383;papers will
de&#383;cribe to you the proce&#383;&#383;ion of the Sans-Culottes,
the indecency of their banners, and the di&#383;orders which were
the re&#383;ult&mdash; but it is impo&#383;&#383;ible for either
them or me to convey an idea of the general indignation excited by
the&#383;e atrocities. Every well-meaning per&#383;on is grieved
for the pre&#383;ent, and apprehen&#383;ive for the future: and I
am not without hope, that this open avowal of the de&#383;igns of
the Jacobins, will unite the Con&#383;titutionali&#383;ts and
Ari&#383;tocrates, and that they will join their efforts in defence
of the Crown, as the only mean&#383; of &#383;aving both from being
overwhelmed by a faction, who are now become too daring to be
de&#383;pi&#383;ed. Many of the municipalities and department&#383;
are preparing to addre&#383;s they King, on the fortitude he
di&#383;played in thi&#383; hour of in&#383;ult and peril.&mdash;I
know not why, but the people have been taught to entertain a mean
opinion of his per&#383;onal courage; and the late violence will at
lea&#383;t have the good effect of undeceiving them. It i&#383;
certain, that he behaved on this occa&#383;ion with the utmo&#383;t
coolne&#383;s; and the Garde Nationale, who&#383;e hand he placed
on his heart, atte&#383;ted that it had no unu&#383;ual
palpitation.</p>
<p>That the King &#383;hould be unwilling to &#383;anction the
rai&#383;ing an army under the immediate au&#383;pice of the avowed
enemies of him&#383;elf, and of the con&#383;titution he has
&#383;worn to protect, cannot be much wondered at; and tho&#383;e
who know the Catholic religion, and con&#383;ider that this Prince
i&#383; devout, and that he has rea&#383;on to &#383;u&#383;pect
the fidelity of all who approach him, will wonder &#383;till
le&#383;s that he refu&#383;es to bani&#383;h a cla&#383;s of men,
who&#383;e influence is exten&#383;ive, and who&#383;e
intere&#383;t it is to pre&#383;erve their attachment to him.</p>
<p>The&#383;e events have thrown a gloom over private
&#383;ocieties; and public amu&#383;ements, as I ob&#383;erved in a
former letter, are little frequented; &#383;o that, on the whole,
time pa&#383;&#383;es heavily with a people who, generally
&#383;peaking, have few re&#383;ources in them&#383;elves. Before
the revolution, France was at this &#383;ea&#383;on a &#383;cene of
much gaiety. Every village had alternately a &#383;ort of Fete,
which nearly an&#383;wers to our Wake&mdash;but with this
difference, that it was numerou&#383;ly attended by all ranks, and
the amu&#383;ement was dancing, in&#383;tead of wre&#383;tling and
drinking. Several &#383;mall fields, or different parts of a large
one, were provided with mu&#383;ic, di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by
flags, and appropriated to the &#383;everal cla&#383;&#383;es of
dancer&#383;&mdash;one for the pea&#383;ants, another for the
bourgeois, and a third for the higher orders. The young people
danced beneath the ardour of a July &#383;un, while the old looked
on and regaled them&#383;elves with beer, cyder, and gingerbread. I
was always much plea&#383;ed with this village fe&#383;tivity: it
gratified my mind more than &#383;elect and expen&#383;ive
amu&#383;ements, becau&#383;e it was general, and within the power
of all who cho&#383;e to partake of it; and the little
di&#383;tinction of rank which was pre&#383;erved, far from
dimini&#383;hing the plea&#383;ure of any, added, I am certain, to
the freedom of all. By mixing with tho&#383;e only of her own
cla&#383;s, the Pay&#383;anne* was &#383;pared the temptation of
envying the pink ribbons of the Bourgeoi&#383;e, who in her turn
was not di&#383;turbed by an immediate rival&#383;hip with the
&#383;a&#383;h and plumes of the provincial belle. But this
cu&#383;tom is now much on the decline. The young women avoid
occa&#383;ions where an inebriated &#383;oldier may offer
him&#383;elf as her partner in the dance, and her refu&#383;al be
attended with in&#383;ult to her&#383;elf, and danger to tho&#383;e
who protect her; and as this licence i&#383; nearly as
offen&#383;ive to the decent Bourgeoi&#383;e as to the female of
higher condition, this &#383;ort of fete will mo&#383;t probably be
entirely abandoned.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*The head-dre&#383;s of the French <i>Pay&#383;anne</i>
is uniformly a &#383;mall cap, without ribbon or ornament of any
kind, except in that part of Normandy which is called the <i>Pays
de Caux,</i> where the Pay&#383;anne&#383; wear a particular kind
of head dre&#383;s, ornamented with &#383;ilver.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The people here all dance much better than tho&#383;e of the
&#383;ame rank in England; but this national accompli&#383;hment is
not in&#383;tinctive: for though few of the laborious cla&#383;s
have been taught to read, there are &#383;carcely any &#383;o poor
as not to be&#383;tow three livres for a quarter's in&#383;truction
from a dancing ma&#383;ter; and with this three month&#383;'
noviciate they become qualified to dance through the re&#383;t of
their lives.</p>
<p>The rage for emigration, and the approach of the Au&#383;trians,
have occa&#383;ioned many re&#383;trictions on travelling,
e&#383;pecially near the &#383;eacoa&#383;t of frontiers. No
per&#383;on can pa&#383;s through a town without a
pa&#383;&#383;port from the municipality he re&#383;ides in,
&#383;pecifying his age, the place of hi&#383; birth, his
de&#383;tination, the height of his per&#383;on, and the features
of hi&#383; face. The Marquis de C____ entered the town
ye&#383;terday, and at the gate pre&#383;ented his
pa&#383;&#383;port as u&#383;ual; the guard looked at the
pa&#383;&#383;port, and in a high tone demanded his name, whence he
came, and where he was going. M. de C____ referred him to the
pa&#383;&#383;port, and &#383;u&#383;pecting the man could not
read, per&#383;i&#383;ted in refu&#383;ing to give a verbal account
of him&#383;elf, but with much civility pre&#383;&#383;ed the
peru&#383;al of the pa&#383;&#383;port; adding, that if it was
informal, Mon&#383;ieur might write to the municipality that
granted it. The man, however, did not approve of the je&#383;t, and
took the Marqui&#383; before the municipality, who &#383;entenced
him to a month's impri&#383;onment for his plea&#383;antry.</p>
<p>The French are becoming very grave, and a bon-mot will not now,
a&#383; formerly, &#383;ave a man's life.&mdash;I do not remember
to have &#383;een in any Engli&#383;h print an anecdote on this
&#383;ubject, which at once marks the levity of the Pari&#383;ians,
and the wit and pre&#383;ence of mind of the Abbe Maury.&mdash;At
the beginning of the revolution, when the people were very much
incen&#383;ed again&#383;t the Abbe, he was one day, on quitting
the A&#383;&#383;embly, &#383;urrounded by an enraged mob, who
&#383;eized on him, and were hurrying him away to execution,
amid&#383;t the univer&#383;al cry of <i>a la lanterne! a la
lanterne!</i> The Abbe, with much coolne&#383;s and good humour,
turned to tho&#383;e neare&#383;t him, <i>"Eh bien mes amis et
quand je &#383;erois a la lanterne, en verriez vous plu&#383;
clair?"</i> Tho&#383;e who held him were di&#383;armed, the bon-mot
flew through the croud, and the Abbe e&#383;caped while they were
applauding it.&mdash;I have nothing to offer after this trait which
is worthy of &#383;ucceeding it, but will add that I am always

<h2>July 24, 1792.</h2>
<p>Our revolution aera has pa&#383;&#383;ed tranquilly in the
provinces, and with le&#383;&#383; turbulence at Paris than was
expected. I con&#383;ign to the Gazette-writer&#383; tho&#383;e
long de&#383;criptions that de&#383;cribe nothing, and leave the
mind a&#383; un&#383;ati&#383;fied as the eye. I content
my&#383;elf with ob&#383;erving only, that the ceremony here was
gay, impre&#383;&#383;ive, and animating. I indeed have often
remarked, that the works of nature are better de&#383;cribed than
tho&#383;e of art. The &#383;cenes of nature, though varied, are
uniform; while the productions of art are &#383;ubject to the
caprices of whim, and the vici&#383;&#383;itudes of ta&#383;te. A
rock, a wood, or a valley, however the &#383;cenery may be
diver&#383;ified, always conveys a perfect and di&#383;tinct image
to the mind; but a temple, an altar, a palace, or a pavilion,
requires a detail, minute even to tediou&#383;ne&#383;s, and which,
after all, gives but an imperfect notion of the object. I have as
often read de&#383;criptions of the Vatican, as of the Bay of
Naples; yet I recollect little of the former, while the latter
&#383;eems almo&#383;t familiar to me.&mdash;Many are &#383;trongly
impre&#383;&#383;ed with the &#383;cenery of Milton's
Paradi&#383;e, who have but confu&#383;ed ideas of the
&#383;plendour of Pandemonium. The de&#383;criptions, however, are
equally minute, and the poetry of both is beautiful.</p>
<p>But to return to this country, which is not ab&#383;olutely a
Paradi&#383;e, and I hope will not become a Pandemonium&mdash;the
ceremony I have been alluding to, though really intere&#383;ting,
is by no means to be con&#383;idered as a proof that the ardour for
liberty increa&#383;es: on the contrary, in proportion a&#383;
the&#383;e fetes become more frequent, the enthu&#383;ia&#383;m
which they excite &#383;eem&#383; to dimini&#383;h. "For ever mark,
Lucilius, when Love begins to &#383;icken and decline, it
u&#383;eth an enforced ceremony." When there were no foederations,
the people were more united. The planting trees of liberty
&#383;eems to have damped the &#383;pirit of freedom; and
&#383;ince there has been a decree for wearing the national
colours, they are more the marks of obedience than proofs of
affection.&mdash;I cannot pretend to decide whether the leaders of
the people find their followers le&#383;s warm than they were, and
think it nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;timulate them by the&#383;e
&#383;hows, or whether the &#383;hows them&#383;elves, by too
frequent repetition, have rendered the people indifferent about the
objects of them.&mdash;Perhaps both the&#383;e
&#383;uppo&#383;ition&#383; are true. The French are volatile and
material; they are not very capable of attachment to principles.
External objects are requi&#383;ite for them, even in a &#383;light
degree; and the momentary enthu&#383;ia&#383;m that i&#383;
obtained by affecting their &#383;en&#383;es &#383;ub&#383;ides
with the conclu&#383;ion of a favourite air, or the end of a gaudy
proce&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>The Jacobin party are daily gaining ground; and &#383;ince they
have forced a mini&#383;try of their own on the King, their triumph
has become &#383;till more in&#383;olent and deci&#383;ive.&mdash;A
&#383;torm is &#383;aid to be hovering over us, which I think of
with dread, and cannot communicate with &#383;afety&mdash;"Heaven
&#383;quare the trial of tho&#383;e who are implicated, to their
proportioned &#383;trength!"&mdash; Adieu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Augu&#383;t 4, 1792.</h2>
<p>I mu&#383;t repeat to you, that I have no talent for
de&#383;cription; and, having &#383;eldom been able to profit by
the de&#383;criptions of others, I am mode&#383;t enough not
willingly to attempt one my&#383;elf. But, as you ob&#383;erve, the
ceremony of a foederation, though familiar to me, is not &#383;o to
my Engli&#383;h friends; I therefore obey your commands, though
certain of not &#383;ucceeding &#383;o as to gratify your
curio&#383;ity in the manner you too partially expect.</p>
<p>The temple where the ceremony was performed, was erected in an
open &#383;pace, well cho&#383;en both for convenience and effect.
In a large circle on this &#383;pot, twelve po&#383;ts, between
fifty and &#383;ixty feet high, were placed at equal
di&#383;tances, except one larger, opening in front by way of
entrance. On each alternate po&#383;t were fa&#383;tened ivy,
laurel, &amp;c. &#383;o as to form a thick body which entirely hid
the &#383;upport. The&#383;e greens were then &#383;horn (in the
manner you &#383;ee in old fa&#383;hioned gardens) into the form of
Doric columns, of dimen&#383;ions proportioned to their height. The
intervening po&#383;ts were covered with white cloth, which was
&#383;o artificially folded, as exactly to re&#383;emble fluted
pillar&#383;&mdash;from the ba&#383;es of which a&#383;cended
&#383;piral wreaths of flowers. The whole wa&#383; connected at top
by a bold fe&#383;toon of foliage, and the capital of each column
was &#383;urmounted by a va&#383;e of white lilies. In the middle
of thi&#383; temple was placed an altar, hung round with lilies,
and on it was depo&#383;ed the book of the con&#383;titution. The
approach to the altar was by a large flight of &#383;teps, covered
with beautiful tape&#383;try.</p>
<p>All this having been arranged and decorated, (a work of
&#383;everal days,) the important aera was u&#383;hered in by the
firing of cannon, ringing of bells, and an appearance of
bu&#383;tle and hilarity not to be &#383;een on any other
occa&#383;ion. About ten, the members of the di&#383;trict, the
municipality, and the judges in their habits of ceremony, met at
the great church, and from thence proceeded to the altar of
liberty. The troops of the line, the Garde Nationale of the town,
and of all the &#383;urrounding communes, then arrived, with each
their re&#383;pective mu&#383;ic and colours, which (re&#383;erving
one only of the latter to di&#383;tingui&#383;h them in the ranks)
they planted round the altar. This done, they retired, and forming
a circle round the temple, left a large intermediate &#383;pace
free. A ma&#383;s was then celebrated with the mo&#383;t perfect
order and decency, and at the conclu&#383;ion were read the rights
of man and the con&#383;titution. The troops, Garde Nationale,
&amp;c. were then addre&#383;&#383;ed by their re&#383;pective
officers, the oath to be faithful to the nation, the law, and the
King, was admini&#383;tered: every &#383;word was drawn, and every
hat waved in the air; while all the bands of mu&#383;ic joined in
the favorite &#383;train of ca ira.&mdash; This was followed by
crowning, with the civic wreaths hung round the altar, a number of
people, who during the year had been in&#383;trumental in
&#383;aving the lives of their fellow-citizens that had been
endangered by drowning or other accidents. This honorary reward was
accompanied by a pecuniary one, and a fraternal embrace from all
the con&#383;tituted bodies. But this was not the grave&#383;t part
of the ceremony. The magi&#383;trates, however upright, were not
all graceful, and the people, though they under&#383;tood the value
of the money, did not that of the civic wreaths, or the embraces;
they therefore looked vacant enough during this part of the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and grinned mo&#383;t facetiou&#383;ly when
they began to examine the appearance of each other in their oaken
crowns, and, I dare &#383;ay, thought the whole comical
enough.&mdash;This is one trait of national pedantry. Becau&#383;e
the Romans awarded a civic wreath for an act of humanity, the
French have adopted the cu&#383;tom; and decorate thus a
&#383;oldier or a &#383;ailor, who never heard of the Romans in his
life, except in extracts from the New Te&#383;tament at
ma&#383;s.</p>
<p>But to return to our fete, of which I have only to add, that the
magi&#383;trates departed in the order they ob&#383;erved in
coming, and the troop&#383; and Garde Nationale filed off with
their hats in the air, and with univer&#383;al acclamations, to the
&#383;ound of ca ira.&mdash;Things of this kind are not
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of de&#383;cription. The detail may be
unintere&#383;ting, while the general effect may have been
impre&#383;&#383;ive. The &#383;pirit of the &#383;cene I have been
endeavouring to recall &#383;eems to have evaporated under my pen;
yet to the &#383;pectator it was gay, elegant, and impo&#383;ing.
The day wa&#383; fine, a brilliant &#383;un glittered on the
banners, and a gentle breeze gave them motion; while the
&#383;ati&#383;fied countenances of the people added &#383;pirit
and animation to the whole.</p>
<p>I mu&#383;t remark to you, that devots, and determined
ari&#383;tocrates, ever attend on the&#383;e occa&#383;ions. The
piety of the one is &#383;hocked at a ma&#383;s by a prie&#383;t
who has taken the oaths, and the pride of the other is not yet
reconciled to confu&#383;ion of ranks and popular fe&#383;tivities.
I a&#383;ked a woman who brings us fruit every day, why &#383;he
had not come on the fourteenth as u&#383;ual. She told me &#383;he
did not come to the town, <i>"a cau&#383;e de la
foederation"&mdash;"Vous etes ari&#383;tocrate donc?"&mdash;"Ah,
mon Dieu non&mdash;ce n'e&#383;t pas que je &#383;uis
ari&#383;tocrate, ou democrate, mais que je &#383;ui&#383;
Chretienne.</i>*"</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"On account of the foederation."&mdash;"You are an
ari&#383;tocrate then, I &#383;uppo&#383;e?"&mdash;"Lord, no! It is
not becau&#383;e I am an ari&#383;tocrate, or a democrate, but
becau&#383;e I am a Chri&#383;tian."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an in&#383;tance, among many others I could produce,
that our legi&#383;lators have been wrong, in connecting any change
of the national religion with the revolution. I am every day
convinced, that this and the a&#383;&#383;ignats are the great
cau&#383;es of the alienation vi&#383;ible in many who were once
the warme&#383;t patriots.&mdash;Adieu: do not envy us our fetes
and ceremonies, while you enjoy a con&#383;titution which requires
no oath to make you cheri&#383;h it: and a national liberty, which
is felt and valued without the aid of extrin&#383;ic
decoration.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Augu&#383;t 15.</h2>
<p>The con&#383;ternation and horror of which I have been partaker,
will more than apologize for my &#383;ilence. It is
impo&#383;&#383;ible for any one, however unconnected with the
country, not to feel an intere&#383;t in its pre&#383;ent
calamities, and to regret them. I have little courage to write even
now, and you mu&#383;t pardon me if my letter &#383;hould bear
marks of the general depre&#383;&#383;ion. All but the faction are
grieved and indignant at the King'&#383; depo&#383;ition; but this
grief is without energy, and this indignation &#383;ilent. The
partizans of the old government, and the friends of the new, are
equally enraged; but they have no union, are &#383;u&#383;picious
of each other, and are &#383;inking under the &#383;tupor of
de&#383;pair, when they &#383;hould be preparing for
revenge.&mdash;It would not be ea&#383;y to de&#383;cribe our
&#383;ituation during the la&#383;t week. The ineffectual efforts
of La Fayette, and the violences occa&#383;ioned by them, had
prepared us for &#383;omething &#383;till more &#383;erious. On the
ninth, we had a letter from one of the repre&#383;entative&#383;
for this department, &#383;trongly expre&#383;&#383;ive of his
apprehen&#383;ions for the morrow, but promi&#383;ing to write if
he &#383;urvived it. The day, on which we expected news, came, but
no po&#383;t, no papers, no diligence, nor any mean&#383; of
information. The &#383;ucceeding night we &#383;at up, expecting
letters by the po&#383;t: &#383;till, however, none arrived; and
the courier only pa&#383;&#383;ed ha&#383;tily through, giving no
detail, but that Paris was <i>a feu et a &#383;ang</i>.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* All fire and &#383;laughter.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>At length, after pa&#383;&#383;ing two days and nights in this
dreadful &#383;u&#383;pence, we received certain intelligence which
even exceeded our fears.&mdash;It i&#383; needle&#383;s to repeat
the horrors that have been perpetrated. The account&#383;
mu&#383;t, ere now, have reached you. Our repre&#383;entative, as
he &#383;eemed to expect, was &#383;o ill treated as to be unable
to write: he was one of tho&#383;e who had voted the approval of La
Fayette's conduct&mdash;all of whom were either
ma&#383;&#383;acred, wounded, or intimidated; and, by this means, a
majority was procured to vote the depo&#383;ition of the King. The
party allow, by their own accounts, eight thou&#383;and
per&#383;ons to have peri&#383;hed on thi&#383; occa&#383;ion; but
the number is &#383;uppo&#383;ed to be much more con&#383;iderable.
No papers are publi&#383;hed at pre&#383;ent except tho&#383;e
who&#383;e editors, being member&#383; of the A&#383;&#383;embly,
and either agents or in&#383;tigators of the ma&#383;&#383;acres,
are, of cour&#383;e, intere&#383;ted in concealing or palliating
them.&mdash;-Mr. De _____ has ju&#383;t now taken up one of
the&#383;e atrocious journals, and exclaims, with tears
&#383;tarting from his eyes, <i>"On a abattu la &#383;tatue d'Henri
quatre!*"</i></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"They have de&#383;troyed the &#383;tatue of Henry the
Fourth."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The &#383;acking of Rome by the Goths offers no picture equal to
the licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s and barbarity committed in a country
which calls it&#383;elf the mo&#383;t enlightened in
Europe.&mdash;But, in&#383;tead of recording the&#383;e horrors, I
will fill up my paper with the Choeur Bearnais.</p>

<p>It was publi&#383;hed &#383;ome time ago in a periodical work,
(written with great &#383;pirit and talents,) called "The Acts of
the Apo&#383;tles," and, I believe, has not yet appeared in
England. The &#383;ituation of the King gives a peculiar
intere&#383;t to the&#383;e &#383;tanzas, which, merely as a
poetical compo&#383;ition, are very beautiful. I have often
attempted to tran&#383;late them, but have always found it
impo&#383;&#383;ible to pre&#383;erve the effect and
&#383;implicity of the original. They are &#383;et to a little
plaintive air, very happily characteri&#383;tic of the words.</p>
<p>Perhaps I &#383;hall not write to you again from hence, as we
depart for A_____ on Tue&#383;day next. A change of &#383;cene will
di&#383;&#383;ipate a little the &#383;eriou&#383;ne&#383;s we have
contracted during the late events. If I were determined to indulge
grief or melancholy, I would never remove from the &#383;pot where
I had formed the re&#383;olution. Man is a proud animal even when
oppre&#383;&#383;ed by mi&#383;fortune. He &#383;eeks for his
tranquility in rea&#383;on and reflection; whereas, a
po&#383;t-chai&#383;e and four, or even a hard-trotting hor&#383;e,
is worth all the philo&#383;ophy in the world.&mdash;But, if, as I
ob&#383;erved before, a man be determined to re&#383;i&#383;t
con&#383;olation, he cannot do better than &#383;tay at home, and
rea&#383;on and pho&#383;ophize.</p>
<p>Adieu:&mdash;the &#383;ituation of my friends in this country
makes me think of England with plea&#383;ure and re&#383;pect; and
I &#383;hall conclude with a very homely couplet, which, after all
the fa&#383;hionable liberality of modern travellers, contains a
great deal of truth:</p>

<h2>Augu&#383;t 22, 1792.</h2>
<p>The hour is pa&#383;t, in which, if the King's friends had
exerted them&#383;elves, they might have procured a movement in his
favour. The people were at fir&#383;t amazed, then grieved; but the
national philo&#383;ophy already begins to operate, and they will
&#383;ink into indifference, till again awakened by &#383;ome new
calamity. The leaders of the faction do not, however, entirely
depend either on the &#383;upinene&#383;s of their
adver&#383;aries, or the &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion of the people.
Money is di&#383;tributed among&#383;t the idle and indigent, and
agents are nightly employed in the public hou&#383;es to comment on
new&#383;papers, written for the purpo&#383;e to blacken the King
and exalt the patrioti&#383;m of the party who have dethroned him.
Much u&#383;e has likewi&#383;e been made of the advances of the
Pru&#383;&#383;ians towards Champagne, and the u&#383;ual mummery
of ceremony has not been wanting. Robe&#383;pierre, in a bur&#383;t
of extemporary energy, previou&#383;ly &#383;tudied, has declared
the country in danger. The declaration has been echoed by all the
departments, and proclaimed to the people with much &#383;olemnity.
We were not behind hand in the ceremonial of the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s, though, &#383;omehow, the effect was not
&#383;o &#383;erious and impo&#383;ing as one could have
wi&#383;hed on &#383;uch an occa&#383;ion. A &#383;mart flag, with
the words "Citizens, the country is in danger," wa&#383; prepared;
the judges and the municipality were in their co&#383;tume, the
troops and Garde Nationale under arms, and an orator,
&#383;urrounded by hi&#383; cortege, harangued in the principal
parts of the town on the text of the banner which waved before
him.</p>
<p>All this was very well; but, unfortunately, in order to
di&#383;tingui&#383;h the orator amid&#383;t the croud, it was
determined he &#383;hould harangue on hor&#383;eback. Now here
aro&#383;e a difficulty which all the ardour of patrioti&#383;m was
not able to &#383;urmount. The French are in general but
indifferent eque&#383;trians; and it &#383;o happened that, in our
municipality, tho&#383;e who could &#383;peak could not ride, and
tho&#383;e who could ride could not &#383;peak. At length, however,
after much debating, it was determined that arms &#383;hould yield
to the gown, or rather, the hor&#383;e to the orator&mdash;with
this precaution, that the monture &#383;hould be properly
&#383;ecured, by an attendant to hold the bridle. Under this
&#383;afeguard, the rhetorician i&#383;&#383;ued forth, and the
fir&#383;t part of the &#383;peech was performed without accident;
but when, by way of relieving the declaimer, the whole military
band began to flouri&#383;h ca ira, the hor&#383;e, even more
patriotic than hi&#383; rider, curvetted and twi&#383;ted with
&#383;o much animation, that however the &#383;pectators might be
delighted, the orator was far from participating in their
&#383;ati&#383;faction. After all this, the &#383;peech was to be
fini&#383;hed, and the &#383;ilence of the mu&#383;ic did not
immediately tranquillize the animal. The orator's eye wandered from
the paper that contained his &#383;peech, with wi&#383;tful glances
toward the mane; the fervor of his indignation again&#383;t the
Au&#383;trians was frequently calmed by the involuntary
&#383;trikings he wa&#383; obliged to &#383;ubmit to; and at the
very cri&#383;is of the emphatic declaration, he &#383;eemed much
le&#383;s occupied by his country's danger than his own. The
people, who were highly amu&#383;ed, I dare &#383;ay, conceived the
whole ceremony to be a rejoicing, and at every repetition that the
country was in danger, joined with great glee in the chorus of
<i>ca ira</i>.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*The oration con&#383;i&#383;ted of &#383;everal parts,
each ending with a kind of burden of <i>"Citoyens, la patri
e&#383;t en danger;"</i> and the arrangers of the ceremony had not
&#383;elected appropriate mu&#383;ic: &#383;o that the band, who
had been accu&#383;tomed to play nothing el&#383;e on public
occa&#383;ions, &#383;truck up <i>ca ira</i> at every declaration
that the country was in danger!</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the &#383;pectators, I believe, had for &#383;ome time
been convinced of the danger that threatened the country, and did
not &#383;uppo&#383;e it much increa&#383;ed by the events of the
war; others were plea&#383;ed with a &#383;how, without troubling
them&#383;elves about the occa&#383;ion of it; and the ma&#383;s,
except when rouzed to attention by their favourite air, or the
exhibitions of the eque&#383;trian orator, looked on with vacant
&#383;tupidity. &mdash;This tremendous flag is now
&#383;u&#383;pended from a window of the Hotel de Ville, where it
is to remain until the in&#383;cription it wears &#383;hall no
longer be true; and I heartily wi&#383;h, the
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es of the country may not be more durable
than the texture on which they are proclaimed.</p>
<p>Our journey is fixed for to-morrow, and all the morning has been
pa&#383;&#383;ed in attendance for our
pa&#383;&#383;ports.&mdash;This affair is not &#383;o quickly
di&#383;patched as you may imagine. The French are, indeed,
&#383;aid to be a very lively people, but we mi&#383;take their
volubility for vivacity; for in their public offices, their
&#383;hops, and in any tran&#383;action of bu&#383;ine&#383;s, no
people on earth can be more tediou&#383;&mdash;they are &#383;low,
irregular, and loquacious; and a retail Engli&#383;h Quaker, with
all his formalities, would di&#383;po&#383;e of half his &#383;tock
in le&#383;s time than you can purcha&#383;e a three &#383;ol&#383;
&#383;tamp from a bri&#383;k French Commis. You may therefore
conceive, that thi&#383; official portraiture of &#383;o many
females was a work of time, and not very plea&#383;ant to the
originals. The delicacy of an Engli&#383;hman may be &#383;hocked
at the idea of examining and regi&#383;tering a lady's features one
after another, like the articles of a bill of lading; but the cold
and &#383;y&#383;tematic gallantry of a Frenchman is not &#383;o
&#383;crupulous.&mdash;The officer, however, who is employed for
this purpo&#383;e here, is civil, and I &#383;u&#383;pected the
infinity of my no&#383;e, and the acutene&#383;s of Mad. de ____'s
chin, might have di&#383;concerted him; but he extricated
him&#383;elf very decently. My no&#383;e is enrolled in the order
of aquilines, and the old lady's chin pared off to a <i>"menton un
peu pointu."</i>&mdash;[A longi&#383;h chin.]</p>
<p>The carriages are ordered for &#383;even to-morrow. Recollect,
that &#383;even females, with all their appointments, are to occupy
them, and then calculate the hour I &#383;hall begin
increa&#383;ing my di&#383;tance from England and my friends. I
&#383;hall not do it without regret; yet perhaps you will be
le&#383;s inclined to pity me than the unfortunate wights who are
to e&#383;cort us. A journey of an hundred miles, with French
hor&#383;es, French carriages, French harne&#383;s, and &#383;uch
an unrea&#383;onable female charge, is, I confe&#383;s, in great
humility, not to be ventured on without a mo&#383;t determined
patience.&mdash;I &#383;hall write to you on our arrival at Arras;
and am, till then, at all times, and in all places, Yours.</p>

<h2>He&#383;din.</h2>
<p>We arrived here la&#383;t night, notwith&#383;tanding the
difficulties of our fir&#383;t &#383;etting out, in tolerable time;
but I have gained &#383;o little in point of repo&#383;e, that I
might as well have continued my journey. We are lodged at an inn
which, though large and the be&#383;t in the town, is &#383;o
di&#383;gu&#383;tingly filthy, that I could not determine to
undre&#383;s my&#383;elf, and am now up and &#383;cribbling, till
my companions &#383;hall be ready. Our embarkation will, I
fore&#383;ee, be a work of time and labour; for my friend, Mad. de
____, be&#383;ides the u&#383;ual attendants on a French woman, a
femme de chambre and a lap-dog, travels with &#383;everal cages of
canary-birds, &#383;ome pots of curiou&#383; exotics, and a
favourite cat; all of which mu&#383;t be di&#383;po&#383;ed of
&#383;o as to produce no inter&#383;tine commotions during the
journey. Now if you con&#383;ider the nature of the&#383;e
fellow-travellers, you will allow it not &#383;o ea&#383;y a matter
as may at fir&#383;t be &#383;uppo&#383;ed, e&#383;pecially as
their fair mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383; will not allow any of them to be
placed in any other carriage than her own.&mdash;A fray happened
ye&#383;terday between the cat and the dog, during which the birds
were over&#383;et, and the plants broken. Poor M. de ____, with a
&#383;ort of rueful good nature, &#383;eparated the combatants,
re&#383;tored order, and was obliged to purcha&#383;e peace by
charging him&#383;elf with the care of the aggre&#383;&#383;or.</p>
<p>I &#383;hould not have dwelt &#383;o long on the&#383;e trifling
occurrences, but that they are characteri&#383;tic. In England,
this pa&#383;&#383;ion for animals is chiefly confined to old
maids, but here it is general. Almo&#383;t every woman, however
numerous her family, has a nur&#383;ery of birds, an angola, and
two or three lap-dogs, who &#383;hare her cares with her
hu&#383;band and children. The dogs have all romantic names, and
are enquired after with &#383;o much &#383;olicitude when they do
not make one in a vi&#383;it, that it was &#383;ome time before I
di&#383;covered that Nina and Ro&#383;ine were not the young ladies
of the family. I do not remember to have &#383;een any
hu&#383;band, however ma&#383;ter of his hou&#383;e in other
re&#383;pects, daring enough to di&#383;place a favourite animal,
even though it occupied the only vacant fauteuil.</p>
<p>The entrance into Artois from Picardy, though confounded by the
new divi&#383;ion, is &#383;ufficiently marked by a higher
cultivation, and a more fertile &#383;oil. The whole country we
have pa&#383;&#383;ed is agreeable, but uniform; the roads are
good, and planted on each &#383;ide with trees, mo&#383;tly elms,
except here and there &#383;ome rows of poplar or apple. The land
i&#383; all open, and &#383;own in divi&#383;ions of corn, carrots,
potatoes, tobacco, and poppies of which la&#383;t they make a
coar&#383;e kind of oil for the u&#383;e of painters. The country
is entirely flat, and the view every where bounded by woods
inter&#383;per&#383;ed with villages, who&#383;e little &#383;pires
peeping through the trees have a very plea&#383;ing effect.</p>
<p>The people of Artois are &#383;aid to be highly
&#383;uper&#383;titious, and we have already pa&#383;&#383;ed a
number of &#383;mall chapels and cro&#383;&#383;es, erected by the
road &#383;ide, and &#383;urrounded by tufts of trees. The&#383;e
are the inventions of a mi&#383;taken piety; yet they are not
entirely without their u&#383;e, and I cannot help regarding them
with more complacence than a rigid Prote&#383;tant might think
allowable. The weary traveller here finds &#383;helter from a
mid-day &#383;un, and &#383;olaces his mind while he repo&#383;es
his body. The glittering equipage rolls by&mdash;he recalls the
painful &#383;teps he has pa&#383;t, anticipate&#383; tho&#383;e
which yet remain, and perhaps is tempted to repine; but when he
turns his eye on the cro&#383;s of Him who has promi&#383;ed a
recompence to the &#383;ufferers of this world, he checks the
&#383;igh of envy, forgets the luxury which excited it, and
pur&#383;ues his way with re&#383;ignation. The Prote&#383;tant
religion pro&#383;cribes, and the character of the Engli&#383;h
render&#383; unnece&#383;&#383;ary, the&#383;e &#383;en&#383;ible
objects of devotion; but I have always been of opinion, that the
levity of the French in general would make them incapable of
per&#383;evering in a form of wor&#383;hip equally ab&#383;tracted
and rational. The Spaniards, and even the Italians, might
aboli&#383;h their cro&#383;&#383;es and images, and yet
pre&#383;erve their Chri&#383;tianity; but if the French
cea&#383;ed to be bigots, they would become athei&#383;ts.</p>
<p>This is a &#383;mall fortified town, though not of &#383;trength
to offer any re&#383;i&#383;tance to artillery. Its proximity to
the frontier, and the dread of the Au&#383;trians, make the
inhabitants very patriotic. We were &#383;urrounded by a great
croud of people on our arrival, who had &#383;ome
&#383;u&#383;picion that we were emigrating; however, as &#383;oon
as our pa&#383;&#383;ports were examined and declared legal, they
retired very peaceably.</p>
<p>The approach of the enemy keeps up the &#383;pirit of the
people, and, notwith&#383;tanding their
di&#383;&#383;ati&#383;faction at the late events, they have not
yet felt the change of their government &#383;ufficiently to
de&#383;ire the inva&#383;ion of an Au&#383;trian army.&mdash;Every
village, every cottage, hailed u&#383; with the cry of Vive la
nation! The cabaret invites you to drink beer a la nation, and
offers you lodging a la nation&mdash;the chandler's &#383;hop
&#383;ell&#383; you &#383;nuff and hair powder a la
nation&mdash;and there are even patriotic barbers who&#383;e
&#383;igns inform you, that you may be &#383;haved and have your
teeth drawn a la nation! The&#383;e are acts of patrioti&#383;m one
cannot rea&#383;onably object to; but the frequent and tedious
examination of one'&#383; pa&#383;&#383;ports by people who can't
read, is not quite &#383;o inoffen&#383;ive, and I &#383;ometimes
lo&#383;e my patience. A very vigilant <i>Garde Nationale</i>
ye&#383;terday, after &#383;pelling my pa&#383;&#383;port over for
ten minutes, objected that it was not a good one. I maintained that
it was; and feeling a momentary importance at the recollection of
my country, added, in an a&#383;&#383;uring tone, <i>"Et d'ailleurs
je &#383;uis Anglai&#383;e et par con&#383;equent libre d'aller ou
bon me &#383;emble.</i>*" The man &#383;tared, but admitted my
argument, and we pa&#383;&#383;ed on.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"Be&#383;ides, I am a native of England, and,
con&#383;equently, have a right to go where I
plea&#383;e."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>My room door is half open, and gives me a pro&#383;pect into
that of Mad. de L____, which is on the oppo&#383;ite &#383;ide of
the pa&#383;&#383;age. She has not yet put on her cap, but her grey
hair is profu&#383;ely powdered; and, with no other garments than a
&#383;hort under petticoat and a cor&#383;et, &#383;he &#383;tands
for the edification of all who pa&#383;s, putting on her rouge with
a &#383;tick and a bundle of cotton tied to the end of
it.&mdash;All travellers agree in de&#383;cribing great indelicacy
to the French women; yet I have &#383;een no accounts which
exaggerate it, and &#383;carce any that have not been more
favourable than a &#383;trict adherence to truth might
ju&#383;tify. Thi&#383; inattractive part of the female national
character is not confined to the lower or middling
cla&#383;&#383;es of life; and an Engli&#383;h woman is as likely
to be put to the blu&#383;h in the boudoir of a Marqui&#383;e, as
in the &#383;hop of the Gri&#383;ette, which &#383;erves al&#383;o
for her dre&#383;&#383;ing-room.</p>
<p>If I am not too idle, or too much amu&#383;ed, you will
&#383;oon be informed of my arrival at Arras; but though I
&#383;hould neglect to write, be per&#383;uaded I &#383;hall never
cea&#383;e to be, with affection and e&#383;teem, Yours,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Arras, Augu&#383;t, 1792.</h2>
<p>The appearance of Arras is not bu&#383;y in proportion to its
population, becau&#383;e its population is not equal to its extent;
and as it is a large, without being a commercial, town, it rather
offers a view of the tranquil enjoyment of wealth, than of the
bu&#383;tle and activity by which it i&#383; procured. The
&#383;treets are mo&#383;tly narrow and ill paved, and the
&#383;hop&#383; look heavy and mean; but the hotels, which chiefly
occupy the low town, are large and numerous. What is called la
Petite Place, is really very large, and &#383;mall only in
compari&#383;on with the great one, which, I believe, is the
large&#383;t in France. It is, indeed, an immen&#383;e
quadrangle&mdash;the hou&#383;es are in the Spani&#383;h form, and
it has an arcade all round it. The Spaniards, by whom it was built,
forgot, probably, that this kind of &#383;helter would not be
&#383;o de&#383;irable here as in their own climate. The
manufacture of tape&#383;try, which a &#383;ingle line of
Shake&#383;peare ha&#383; immortalized, and a&#383;&#383;ociated
with the mirthful image of his fat Knight, has fallen into decay.
The manufacturers of linen and woollen are but incon&#383;iderable;
and one, which exi&#383;ted till lately, of a very durable
porcelain, is totally neglected. The principal article of commerce
i&#383; lace, which is made here in great quantities. The people of
all ages, from five years old to &#383;eventy, are employed in this
delicate fabrick. In fine weather you will &#383;ee whole
&#383;treets lined with females, each with her cu&#383;hion on her
lap. The people of Arras are uncommonly dirty, and the lacemakers
do not in this matter differ from their fellow-citizens; yet at the
door of a hou&#383;e, which, but for the &#383;urrounding ones, you
would &#383;uppo&#383;e the common receptacle of all the filth in
the vicinage, i&#383; often &#383;eated a female artizan,
who&#383;e fingers are forming a point of unblemi&#383;hed
whitene&#383;s. It is inconceivable how fa&#383;t the bobbins move
under their hands; and they &#383;eem to be&#383;tow &#383;o little
attention on their work, that it looks more like the amu&#383;ement
of idlene&#383;s than an effort of indu&#383;try. I am no judge of
the arguments of philo&#383;ophers and politician&#383; for and
again&#383;t the u&#383;e of luxury in a &#383;tate; but if it be
allowable at all, much may be &#383;aid in favour of this
plea&#383;ing article of it. Children may be taught to make it at a
very early age, and they can work at home under the in&#383;pection
of their parents, which is certainly preferable to crouding them
together in manufactories, where their health is injured, and their
morals are corrupted.</p>
<p>By requiring no more implements than about five &#383;hillings
will purcha&#383;e, a lacemaker is not dependent on the
&#383;hopkeeper, nor the head of a manufactory. All who choo&#383;e
to work have it in their own power, and can di&#383;po&#383;e of
the produce of their labour, without being at the mercy of an
avaricious employer; for though a tolerable good workwoman can gain
a decent livelihood by &#383;elling to the &#383;hops, yet the
profit of the retailer is &#383;o great, that if he rejected a
piece of lace, or refu&#383;ed to give a rea&#383;onable price for
it, a certain &#383;ale would be found with the individual
con&#383;umer: and it is a proof of the independence of thi&#383;
employ, that no one will at pre&#383;ent di&#383;po&#383;e of their
work for paper, and it &#383;till continues to be paid for in
money. Another argument in favour of encouraging lace-making is,
that it cannot be u&#383;urped by men: you may have men-milliners,
men-mantuamakers, and even ladie&#383;' valets, but you cannot well
fa&#383;hion the clum&#383;y and inflexible fingers of man to
lace-making. We import great quantities of lace from this country,
yet I imagine we might, by attention, be enabled to &#383;upply
other countries, in&#383;tead of purcha&#383;ing abroad
our&#383;elves. The art of &#383;pinning is daily improving in
England; and if thread &#383;ufficiently fine can be manufactured,
there is no rea&#383;on why we &#383;hould not equal our
neighbour&#383; in the beauty of this article. The hands of
Engli&#383;h women are more delicate than tho&#383;e of the French;
and our climate is much the &#383;ame a&#383; that of
Bru&#383;&#383;els, Arras, Li&#383;le, &amp;c. where the
fine&#383;t lace is made.</p>
<p>The population of Arras is e&#383;timated at about twenty-five
thou&#383;and &#383;ouls, though many people tell me it is greater.
It has, however, been lately much thinned by emigration,
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion of convents, and the decline of trade,
occa&#383;ioned by the ab&#383;ence of &#383;o many rich
inhabitants.&mdash;The Jacobins are here become very formidable:
they have taken po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of a church for
their meetings, and, from being the ridicule, are become the terror
of all moderate people.</p>
<p>Ye&#383;terday was appointed for taking the new oath of liberty
and equality. I did not &#383;ee the ceremony, as the town was in
much confu&#383;ion, and it wa&#383; deemed un&#383;afe to be from
home. I under&#383;tand it was attended only by the very
refu&#383;e of the people, and that, as a gallanterie analogue, the
Pre&#383;ident of the department gave his arm to Madame Duchene,
who &#383;ell&#383; apples in a cellar, and is Pre&#383;idente of
the Jacobin club. It is, however, reported to-day, that &#383;he is
in di&#383;grace with the &#383;ociety for her
conde&#383;cen&#383;ion; and her parading the town with a man of
forty thou&#383;and livres a year is thought to be too great a
compliment to the ari&#383;tocracy of riches; &#383;o that Mons. Le
Pre&#383;ident's political gallantry has availed him nothing. He
has deba&#383;ed and made him&#383;elf the ridicule of the
Ari&#383;tocrates and Con&#383;titutionali&#383;ts, without paying
his court, as he intended, to the popular faction. I would always
wi&#383;h it to happen &#383;o to tho&#383;e who offer up
incen&#383;e to the mob. As human beings, as one's fellow
creatures, the poor and uninformed have a claim to our affection
and benevolence, but when they become legi&#383;lators, they are
ab&#383;urd and contemptible tyrants.&mdash;<i>A
propo&#383;</i>&mdash;we were obliged to acknowledge this new
&#383;overeignty by illuminating the hou&#383;e on the
occa&#383;ion; and this was not ordered by nocturnal vociferation
as in England, but by a regular command from an officer deputed for
that purpo&#383;e.</p>
<p>I am concerned to &#383;ee the people accu&#383;tomed to take a
number of incompatible oaths with indifference: it neither will nor
can come to any good; and I am ready to exclaim with
Juliet&mdash;"Swear not at all." Or, if ye mu&#383;t &#383;wear,
quarrel not with the Pope, that your con&#383;ciences may at
lea&#383;t be relieved by di&#383;pen&#383;ations and
indulgences.</p>
<p>To-morrow we go to Li&#383;le, notwith&#383;tanding the report
that it has already been &#383;ummoned to &#383;urrender. You will
&#383;carcely &#383;uppo&#383;e it po&#383;&#383;ible, yet we find
it difficult to learn the certainty of this, at the di&#383;tance
of only thirty miles: but communication is much le&#383;s frequent
and ea&#383;y here than in England. I am not one of tho&#383;e
"unfortunate women who delight in war;" and, perhaps, the
&#383;ight of this place, &#383;o famous for it&#383;
fortifications, will not be very amu&#383;ing to me, nor
furni&#383;h much matter of communication for my friends; but I
&#383;hall write, if it be only to a&#383;&#383;ure you that I am
not made prize of by the Au&#383;trians. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Li&#383;le, Augu&#383;t, 1792.</h2>
<p>You re&#383;tle&#383;s i&#383;landers, who are continually
racking imagination to perfect the art of moving from one place to
another, and who can drop a&#383;leep in a carriage and wake at an
hundred mile di&#383;tance, have no notion of all the difficulties
of a day's journey here. In the fir&#383;t place, all the
hor&#383;es of private per&#383;ons have been taken for the
u&#383;e of the army, and tho&#383;e for hire are con&#383;tantly
employed in going to the camp&mdash;hence, there is a difficulty in
procuring hor&#383;es. Then a French carriage i&#383; never in
order, and in France a job is not to be done ju&#383;t when you
want it&mdash;&#383;o that there is often a difficulty in finding
vehicles. Then there is the difficulty of pa&#383;&#383;ports, and
the difficulty of gates, if you want to depart early. Then the
difficulties of patching harne&#383;s on the road, and, above all,
the inflexible <i>&#383;ang froid</i> of drivers. All the&#383;e
thing&#383; con&#383;idered, you will not wonder that we came here
a day after we intended, and arrived at night, when we ought to
have arrived at noon. &mdash;The carriage wanted a trifling repair,
and we could get neither pa&#383;&#383;ports nor hor&#383;es. The
hor&#383;es were gone to the army&mdash;the municipality to the
club&mdash;and the black&#383;mith was employed at the barracks in
making a patriotic harangue to the &#383;oldiers.&mdash;But we at
length &#383;urmounted all the&#383;e ob&#383;tacles, and reached
this place la&#383;t night.</p>
<p>The road between Arras and Li&#383;le is equally rich with that
we before pa&#383;&#383;ed, but is much more diver&#383;ified. The
plain of Lens is not &#383;uch a &#383;cene of fertility, that one
forgets it has once been that of war and carnage. We endeavoured to
learn in the town whereabouts the column wa&#383; erected that
commemmorates that famous battle, [1648.] but no one &#383;eemed to
know any thing of the matter. One who, we flattered our&#383;elves,
looked more intelligent than the re&#383;t, and whom we
&#383;uppo&#383;ed might be an attorney, upon being a&#383;ked for
this &#383;pot,&mdash;(where, added Mr. de ____, by way of
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ting his memory, <i>"le Prince de Conde
&#383;'e&#383;t battu &#383;i bien,"</i>) &mdash;replied, <i>"Pour
la bataille je n'en &#383;ais rien, mais pour le Prince de Conde il
y a deja quelque tems qu'il e&#383;t emigre&mdash;on le dit a
Coblentz."</i>* After this we thought it in vain to make any
farther enquiry, and continued our walk about the town.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"Where the Prince of Conde fought &#383;o
gallantly."&mdash;"As to the battle I know nothing about the
matter; but for the Prince of Conde he emigrated &#383;ome time
&#383;ince&mdash;they &#383;ay he is at Coblentz."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. P____, who, according to French cu&#383;tom, had not
breakfa&#383;ted, took a fancy to &#383;top at a baker's &#383;hop
and buy a roll. The man be&#383;towed &#383;o much more civility on
us than our two &#383;ols were worth, that I ob&#383;erved, on
quitting the &#383;hop, I was &#383;ure he mu&#383;t be an
Ari&#383;tocrate. Mr. P____, who is a warm
Con&#383;titutionali&#383;t, di&#383;puted the ju&#383;tice of my
inference, and we agreed to return, and learn the baker's political
principles. After a&#383;king for more rolls, we acco&#383;ted him
with the u&#383;ual phra&#383;e, "Et vous, Mon&#383;ieur, vous etes
bon patriote?"&mdash;<i>"Ah, mon Dieu, oui,</i> (replied he,) <i>il
faut bien l'etre a pre&#383;ent."</i>*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"And you, Sir, are without doubt, a good
patriot?"&mdash;"Oh Lord, Sir, yes; one's obliged to be &#383;o,
now-a-days."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. P____ admitted the man's tone of voice and countenance as
good evidence, and acknowledged I was right.&mdash;It is certain
that the French have taken it into their heads, that
coar&#383;ene&#383;s of manners is a nece&#383;&#383;ary
con&#383;equence of liberty, and that there is a kind of leze
nation in being too civil; &#383;o that, in general, I think I can
di&#383;cover the principles of &#383;hopkeepers, even without the
indications of a melancholy mien at the a&#383;&#383;ignats, or
lamentations on the times.</p>
<p>The new doctrine of primeval equality has already made &#383;ome
progre&#383;s. At a &#383;mall inn at Carvin, where, upon the
a&#383;&#383;urance that they had every thing in the world, we
&#383;topped to dine, on my ob&#383;erving they had laid more
covers than were nece&#383;&#383;ary, the woman an&#383;wered, "Et
les dome&#383;tiques, ne dinent ils pas?"&mdash;"And, pray, are the
&#383;ervants to have no dinner?"</p>
<p>We told her not with us, and the plates were taken away; but we
heard her muttering in the kitchen, that &#383;he believed we were
ari&#383;tocrates going to emigrate. She might imagine al&#383;o
that we were difficult to &#383;ati&#383;fy, for we found it
impo&#383;&#383;ible to dine, and left the hou&#383;e hungry,
notwith&#383;tanding there was "every thing in the world" in
it.</p>
<p>On the road between Carvin and Li&#383;le we &#383;aw Dumouriez,
who is going to take the command of the army, and has now been
vi&#383;iting the camp of Maulde. He appears to be under the middle
&#383;ize, about fifty years of age, with a brown complexion, dark
eyes, and an animated countenance. He was not originally
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed either by birth or fortune, and ha&#383;
arrived at his pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation by a concurrence of
fortuitou&#383; circum&#383;tances, by great and various talents,
much addre&#383;s, and a &#383;pirit of intrigue. He is now
&#383;upported by the prevailing party; and, I confe&#383;s, I
could not regard with much complacence a man, whom the machinations
of the Jacobins had forced into the mini&#383;try, and who&#383;e
hypocritical and affected re&#383;ignation has contributed to
deceive the people, and ruin the King.</p>
<p>Li&#383;le has all the air of a great town, and the mixture of
commercial indu&#383;try and military occupation gives it a very
gay and populou&#383; appearance. The Lillois are highly patriotic,
highly incen&#383;ed again&#383;t the Au&#383;trians, and regard
the approaching &#383;iege with more contempt than
apprehen&#383;ion. I a&#383;ked the &#383;ervant who was making my
bed this morning, how far the enemy was off. <i>"Une lieue et
demie, ou deux lieues, a moin&#383; qu'ils ne &#383;oient plus
avances depuis hier,"</i>* repled &#383;he, with the utmo&#383;t
indifference.&mdash;I own, I did not much approve of &#383;uch a
vicinage, and a view of the fortifications (which did not make the
le&#383;s impre&#383;&#383;ion, becau&#383;e I did not
under&#383;tand them,) was ab&#383;olutely nece&#383;&#383;ary to
rai&#383;e my drooping courage.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"A league and a half, or two leagues; unle&#383;s,
indeed, they have advanced &#383;ince ye&#383;terday."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This morning was dedicated to vi&#383;iting the churches,
citadel, and Colli&#383;ee (a place of amu&#383;ement in the manner
of our Vauxhall); but all the&#383;e things have been &#383;o often
de&#383;cribed by much abler pens, that I cannot mode&#383;tly
pretend to add any thing on the &#383;ubject.</p>
<p>In the evening we were at the theatre, which is large and
hand&#383;ome; and the con&#383;tant re&#383;idence of a numerous
garri&#383;on enables it to entertain a very good &#383;et of
performers:&mdash;their operas in particular are extremely well got
up. I &#383;aw Zemire et Azor given better than at Drury
Lane.&mdash;In the farce, which was called Le Francois a Londres,
was introduced a character they called that of an Engli&#383;hman,
(Jack Roa&#383;tbeef,) who pay&#383; his addre&#383;&#383;es to a
nobleman's daughter, in a box coate, a large hat &#383;louched over
his eyes, and an oaken trowel in his hand&mdash;in &#383;hort, the
whole figure exactly re&#383;embling that of a watchman. His
conver&#383;ation i&#383; gro&#383;s and &#383;arca&#383;tic,
interlarded with oaths, or relieved by fits of &#383;ullen
taciturnity&mdash;&#383;uch a lover as one may &#383;uppo&#383;e,
though rich, and the choice of the lady's father, makes no
impre&#383;&#383;ion; and the author ha&#383; flattered the
national vanity by making the heroine give the preference to a
French marquis. Now there is no doubt but nine-tenths of the
audience thought this a good portraiture of the Engli&#383;h
character, and enjoyed it with all the &#383;ati&#383;faction of
con&#383;cious &#383;uperiority.&mdash;The ignorance that prevails
with regard to our manners and cu&#383;toms, among a people &#383;o
near us, is &#383;urprizing. It is true, that the
noble&#383;&#383;e who have vi&#383;ited England with proper
recommendations, and have been introduced to the be&#383;t
&#383;ociety, do us ju&#383;tice: the men of letters al&#383;o,
who, from party motives, extol every thing Engli&#383;h, have done
us perhaps more than ju&#383;tice. But I &#383;peak of the French
in general; not the lower cla&#383;&#383;e&#383; only, but the
gentry of the provinces, and even tho&#383;e who in other
re&#383;pects have preten&#383;ions to information. The fact is,
living in England is expen&#383;ive: a Frenchman, who&#383;e income
here &#383;upports him as a gentleman, goes over and finds all his
habits of oeconomy in&#383;ufficient to keep him from exceeding the
limits he had pre&#383;cribed to him&#383;elf. His decent lodging
alone co&#383;ts him a great part of his revenue, and obliges him
to be &#383;trictly par&#383;imonious of the re&#383;t. This drives
him to a&#383;&#383;ociate chiefly with his own countrymen, to dine
at ob&#383;cure coffee-hou&#383;es, and pay his court to
opera-dancers. He &#383;ees, indeed, our theatres, our public
walks, the out&#383;ide of our palaces, and the in&#383;ide of
churches: but this gives him no idea of the manners of the people
in &#383;uperior life, or even of ea&#383;y fortune. Thus he goes
home, and a&#383;&#383;erts to his untravelled countrymen, that our
King and nobility are ill lodged, our churches mean, and that the
Engli&#383;h are barbarians, who dine without &#383;oup, u&#383;e
no napkin, and eat with their knives.&mdash;I have heard a
gentleman of &#383;ome re&#383;pectability here ob&#383;erve, that
our u&#383;ual dinner was an immen&#383;e joint of meat half
dre&#383;t, and a di&#383;h of vegetables &#383;carcely dre&#383;t
at all.&mdash;Upon que&#383;tioning him, I di&#383;covered he had
lodged in St. Martin's Lane, had likewi&#383;e boarded at a country
attorney's of the lowe&#383;t cla&#383;s, and dined at an ordinary
at Margate.</p>
<p>Some few weeks ago the Marquis de P____ &#383;et out from Paris
in the diligence, and accompanied by his &#383;ervant, with a
de&#383;ign of emigrating. Their only fellow-traveller was an
Engli&#383;hman, whom they frequently addre&#383;&#383;ed, and
endeavoured to enter into conver&#383;ation with; but he either
remained &#383;ilent, or gave them to under&#383;tand he was
entirely ignorant of the language. Under this per&#383;ua&#383;ion
the Marquis and his valet freely di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed their
affairs, arranged their plan of emigration, and
expre&#383;&#383;ed, with little ceremony, their political
opinions.&mdash;At the end of their journey they were denounced by
their companion, and conducted to pri&#383;on. The magi&#383;trate
who took the information mentioned the circum&#383;tance when I
happened to be pre&#383;ent. Indignant at &#383;uch an act in an
Engli&#383;hman, I enquired his name. You will judge of my
&#383;urprize, when he a&#383;&#383;ured me it was the Engli&#383;h
Amba&#383;&#383;ador. I ob&#383;erved to him, that it was not
common for our Amba&#383;&#383;adors to travel in
&#383;tage-coaches: this, he &#383;aid, he knew; but that having
rea&#383;on to &#383;u&#383;pect the Marquis, Mon&#383;ieur
l'Amba&#383;&#383;adeur had had the goodne&#383;s to have him
watched, and had taken this journey on purpo&#383;e to detect him.
It was not without much rea&#383;oning, and the evidence of a lady
who had been in England long enough to know the
impo&#383;&#383;ibility of &#383;uch a thing, that I would
ju&#383;tify Lord G____ from this piece of complai&#383;ance to the
Jacobins, and convince the worthy magi&#383;trate he had been
impo&#383;ed upon: yet this man is the Profe&#383;&#383;or of
Eloquence at a college, is the oracle of the Jacobin &#383;ociety;
and may perhaps become a member of the Convention. This &#383;eems
&#383;o almo&#383;t incredibly ab&#383;urd, that I &#383;hould fear
to repeat it, were it not known to many be&#383;ides my&#383;elf;
but I think I may venture to pronounce, from my own
ob&#383;ervation, and that of others, who&#383;e judgement, and
occa&#383;ions of exerci&#383;ing it, give weight to their
opinions, that the generality of the French who have read a little
are mere pedants, nearly unacquainted with modern nations, their
commercial and political relation, their internal laws, characters,
or manners. Their &#383;tudies are chiefly confined to Rollin and
Plutarch, the dei&#383;tical works of Voltaire, and the
vi&#383;ionary politics of Jean Jaques. Hence they amu&#383;e their
hearers with allu&#383;ion&#383; to Cae&#383;ar and Lycurgus, the
Rubicon, and Thermopylae. Hence they pretend to be too enlightened
for belief, and de&#383;pi&#383;e all governments not founded on
the Contrat Social, or the Profe&#383;&#383;ion de Foi.&mdash;They
are an age removed from the u&#383;eful literature and general
information of the middle cla&#383;&#383;e&#383; in their own
country&mdash;they talk familiarly of Sparta and Lacedemon, and
have about the &#383;ame idea of Ru&#383;&#383;ia as they have of
Caffraria. Yours.</p>

<h2>Li&#383;le.</h2>
<p>"Married to another, and that before tho&#383;e &#383;hoes were
old with which &#383;he followed my poor father to the
grave."&mdash;There is &#383;carcely any circum&#383;tance, or
&#383;ituation, in which, if one's memory were good, one
&#383;hould not be mentally quoting Shake&#383;peare. I have
ju&#383;t now been whi&#383;pering the above, as I pa&#383;&#383;ed
the altar of liberty, which &#383;till remains on the Grande Place.
But "a month, a little month," ago, on thi&#383; altar the French
&#383;wore to maintain the con&#383;titution, and to be faithful to
the law and the King; yet this con&#383;titution is no more, the
laws are violated, the King is dethroned, and the altar is now only
a monument of levity and perjury, which they have not feeling
enough to remove.</p>
<p>The Au&#383;trians are daily expected to be&#383;iege this
place, and they may de&#383;troy, but they will not take it. I do
not, as you may &#383;uppo&#383;e, venture to &#383;peak &#383;o
deci&#383;ively in a military point of view&mdash;I know a&#383;
little as po&#383;&#383;ible of the excellencies of Vauban, or the
adequacy of the garri&#383;on; but I draw my inference from the
&#383;pirit of enthu&#383;ia&#383;m which prevails among the
inhabitants of every cla&#383;&#383;&mdash;every individual
&#383;eems to partake of it: the &#383;treets re&#383;ound with
patriotic acclamations, patriotic &#383;ongs, war, and
defiance.&mdash;Nothing can be more animating than the theatre.
Every allu&#383;ion to the Au&#383;trians, every &#383;ong or
&#383;entence, expre&#383;&#383;ive of determined
re&#383;i&#383;tance, is followed by bur&#383;ts of
a&#383;&#383;ent, ea&#383;ily di&#383;tingui&#383;hable not to be
the effort of party, but the &#383;entiment of the people in
general. There are, doubtle&#383;s, here, as in all other places,
party di&#383;&#383;en&#383;ions; but the threatened &#383;iege
&#383;eems at lea&#383;t to have united all for their common
defence: they know that a bomb makes no di&#383;tinction between
Feuillans, Jacobins, or Ari&#383;tocrates, and neither are &#383;o
anxious to de&#383;troy the other, when it is only to be done at
&#383;uch a ri&#383;k to them&#383;elves. I am even willing to hope
that &#383;omething better than mere &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s has
a &#383;hare in their uniting to pre&#383;erve one of the
fine&#383;t, and, in every &#383;en&#383;e, one of the mo&#383;t
intere&#383;ting, towns in France.</p>

<h2>Li&#383;le, Saturday.</h2>
<p>We are ju&#383;t on our departure for Arras, where, I fear, we
&#383;hall &#383;carcely arrive before the gates are &#383;hut. We
have been detained here much beyond our time, by a
circum&#383;tance infinitely &#383;hocking, though, in fact, not
properly a &#383;ubject of regret. One of the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins of General Dillon wa&#383; this
morning guillotined before the hotel where we are lodged.&mdash;I
did not, as you will conclude, &#383;ee the operation; but the mere
circum&#383;tance of knowing the moment it was performed, and being
&#383;o near it, has much unhinged me. The man, however,
de&#383;erved his fate, and &#383;uch an example was particularly
nece&#383;&#383;ary at this time, when we are without a government,
and the laws are relaxed. The mere privation of life is, perhaps,
more quickly effected by this in&#383;trument than by any other
means; but when we recollect that the preparation for, and
apprehen&#383;ion of, death, con&#383;titute its greate&#383;t
terrors; that a human hand mu&#383;t give motion to the Guillotine
as well as to the axe; and that either accu&#383;tom&#383; a
people, already &#383;anguinary, to the &#383;ight of blood, I
think little i&#383; gained by the invention. It was imagined by a
Mons. Guillotin, a phy&#383;ician of Paris, and member of the
Con&#383;tituent A&#383;&#383;embly. The original de&#383;ign
&#383;eems not &#383;o much to &#383;pare pain to the criminal, as
obloquy to the executioner. I, however, perceive little difference
between a man'&#383; directing a Guillotine, or tying a rope; and I
believe the people are of the &#383;ame opinion. They will never
&#383;ee any thing but a <i>bourreau</i> [executioner] in the man
who&#383;e province it is to execute the &#383;entence of the laws,
whatever name he may be called by, or whatever in&#383;trument he
may make u&#383;e of.&mdash;I have concluded this letter with a
very unplea&#383;ant &#383;ubject, but my pen is guided by
circum&#383;tances, and I do not invent, but
communicate.&mdash;Adieu. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Arras, September 1, 1792.</h2>
<p>Had I been accompanied by an antiquary this morning, his
&#383;en&#383;ibility would have been &#383;everely exerci&#383;ed;
for even I, who&#383;e re&#383;pect for antiquity is not
&#383;cientific, could not help lamenting the modern rage for
deva&#383;tation which has &#383;eized the French. They are
removing all "the time-honoured figure&#383;" of the cathedral, and
painting its ma&#383;&#383;ive &#383;upporters in the &#383;tyle of
a ball-room. The elaborate uncouthne&#383;s of ancient
&#383;culpture is not, indeed, very beautiful; yet I have often
fancied there was &#383;omething more &#383;imply pathetic in the
aukward effigy of an hero kneeling amid&#383;t his trophies, or a
regal pair with their &#383;upplicating hands and &#383;urrounding
off&#383;pring, than in the graceful figures and poetic allegories
of the modern arti&#383;t. The humble intreaty to the reader to
"praye for the &#383;oule of the departed," is not very
elegant&mdash;yet it is better calculated to recall the wanderings
of morality, than the flattering epitaph, a Fame hovering in the
air, or the &#383;u&#383;pended wreath of the remunerating
angel.&mdash;But I moralize in vain&mdash;the rage of the&#383;e
new Goths is inexorable: they &#383;eem &#383;olicitous to
de&#383;troy every ve&#383;tige of civilization, le&#383;t the
people &#383;hould remember they have not always been
barbarians.</p>
<p>After obtaining an order from the municipality, we went to
&#383;ee the gardens and palace of the Bi&#383;hop, who has
emigrated. The garden ha&#383; nothing very remarkable, but is
large and well laid out, according to the old &#383;tyle. It forms
a very agreeable walk, and, when the Bi&#383;hop
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;t it, was open for the enjoyment of the
inhabitants, but it is now &#383;hut up and in di&#383;order. The
hou&#383;e is plain, and &#383;ub&#383;tantially furni&#383;hed,
and exhibits no appearance of unbecoming luxury. The whole is now
the property of the nation, and will &#383;oon be
di&#383;po&#383;ed of.&mdash;I could not help feeling a
&#383;en&#383;ation of melancholy as we walked over the apartments.
Every thing is marked in an inventory, ju&#383;t as left; and an
air of arrangement and re&#383;idence leads one to reflect, that
the owner did not imagine at his departure he was quitting it
perhaps for ever. I am not partial to the original emigrants, yet
much may be &#383;aid for the Bi&#383;hop of Arras. He was
pur&#383;ued by ingratitude, and marked for per&#383;ecution. The
Robe&#383;pierres were young men whom he had taken from a mean
&#383;tate, had educated, and patronized. The revolution gave them
an opportunity of di&#383;playing their talents, and their talents
procured them popularity. They became enemies to the clergy,
becau&#383;e their patron was a Bi&#383;hop; and endeavoured to
render their benefactor odious, becau&#383;e the world could not
forget, nor they forgive, how much they were indebted to
him.&mdash;Vice is not often pa&#383;&#383;ive; nor is there often
a medium between gratitude for benefits, and hatred to the author
of them. A little mind is hurt by the remembrance of
obligation&mdash;begins by forgetting, and, not uncommonly, ends by
per&#383;ecuting.</p>
<p>We dined and pa&#383;&#383;ed the afternoon from home to-day.
After dinner our ho&#383;te&#383;s, as u&#383;ual, propo&#383;ed
cards; and, as u&#383;ual in French &#383;ocieties, every one
a&#383;&#383;ented: we waited, however, &#383;ome time, and no
cards came&mdash; till, at length, conver&#383;ation-parties were
formed, and they were no longer thought of. I have &#383;ince
learned, from one of the young women of the hou&#383;e, that the
butler and two footmen had all betaken them&#383;elves to clubs and
Guinguettes,* and the cards, counters, &amp;c. could not be
obtained.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Small public hou&#383;es in the vicinity of large
towns, where the common people go on Sundays and fe&#383;tivals to
dance and make merry.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another evil ari&#383;ing from the circum&#383;tances of
the times. All people of property have begun to bury their money
and plate, and as the &#383;ervants are often unavoidably privy to
it, they are become idle and impertinent&mdash;they make a kind of
commutation of diligence for fidelity, and imagine that the
ob&#383;ervance of the one exempts them from the
nece&#383;&#383;ity of the other. The clubs are a con&#383;tant
receptacle for idlene&#383;s; and &#383;ervants who think proper to
frequent them do it with very little ceremony, knowing that few
whom they &#383;erve would be imprudent enough to di&#383;charge
them for their patrioti&#383;m in attending a Jacobin &#383;ociety.
Even &#383;ervants who are not converts to the new principle cannot
re&#383;i&#383;t the temptation of abu&#383;ing a little the power
which they acquire from a knowledge of family affairs. Perhaps the
effect of the revolution has not, on the whole, been favourable to
the morals of the lower cla&#383;&#383; of people; but this
&#383;hall be the &#383;ubject of di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion at
&#383;ome future period, when I &#383;hall have had farther
opportunities of judging.</p>
<p>We ye&#383;terday vi&#383;ited the Oratoire, a &#383;eminary for
education, which is now &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed. The building is
immen&#383;e, and admirably calculated for the purpo&#383;e, but is
already in a &#383;tate of dilapidation; &#383;o that, I fear, by
the time the legi&#383;lature has determined what &#383;y&#383;tem
of in&#383;truction &#383;hall be &#383;ub&#383;tituted for that
which has been aboli&#383;hed, the children (as the French are fond
of examples from the ancients) will take their le&#383;&#383;ons,
like the Greeks, in the open air; and, in the mean while, become
expert in lying and thieving, like the Spartans.</p>
<p>The Superior of the hou&#383;e is an immoderate
revolutioni&#383;t, &#383;peaks Engli&#383;h very well, and is a
great admirer of our party writers. In his room I ob&#383;erved a
va&#383;t quantity of Engli&#383;h books, and on his chimney
&#383;tood what he called a patriotic clock, the dial of which was
placed between two pyramids, on which were in&#383;cribed the names
of republican authors, and on the top of one was that of our
countryman, Mr. Thomas Paine&mdash;whom, by the way, I
under&#383;tand you intended to exhibit in a much more
con&#383;picuous and le&#383;s tranquil &#383;ituation. I
a&#383;&#383;ure you, though you are ungrateful on your &#383;ide
of the water, he is in high repute here&mdash;his works are
tran&#383;lated&mdash; all the Jacobins who can read quote, and all
who can't, admire him; and po&#383;&#383;ibly, at the very moment
you are &#383;entencing him to an in&#383;tallment in the pillory,
we may be awarding him a triumph.&mdash;Perhaps we are both right.
He de&#383;erves the pillory, from you for having endeavoured to
de&#383;troy a good con&#383;titution&mdash;and the French may with
equal rea&#383;on grant him a triumph, as their con&#383;titution
is likely to be &#383;o bad, that even Mr. Thomas Paine's writings
may make it better!</p>
<p>Our hou&#383;e is &#383;ituated within view of a very
plea&#383;ant public walk, where I am daily amu&#383;ed with a
&#383;ight of the recruits at their exerci&#383;e. This i&#383; not
quite &#383;o regular a bu&#383;ine&#383;s as the drill in the
Park. The exerci&#383;e is often interrupted by di&#383;putes
between the officer and his eleve&#383;&mdash;&#383;ome are for
turning to the right, others to the left, and the matter is not
unfrequently adju&#383;ted by each going the way that &#383;eemeth
be&#383;t unto him&#383;elf. The author of the <i>"Actes des
Apotre&#383;"</i> [The Acts of the Apo&#383;tles] cites a Colonel
who reprimanded one of his corps for walking ill&mdash;<i>"Eh
Dicentre,</i> (replied the man,) <i>comment veux tu que je marche
bien quand tu as fait mes &#383;ouliers trop etroits."</i>* but
this is no longer a plea&#383;antry&mdash;&#383;uch
circum&#383;tances are very common. A Colonel may often be tailor
to his own regiment, and a Captain operated on the heads of
hi&#383; whole company, in his civil capacity, before he commands
them in hi&#383; military one.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"And how the deuce can you expect me to march well,
when you have made my &#383;hoes too tight?"</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The walks I have ju&#383;t mentioned have been extremely
beautiful, but a great part of the trees have been cut down, and
the ornamental part&#383; de&#383;troyed, &#383;ince the
revolution&mdash;I know not why, as they were open to the poor as
well as the rich, and were a great embelli&#383;hment to the low
town. You may think it &#383;trange that I &#383;hould be
continually dating &#383;ome de&#383;truction from the aera of the
revolution&mdash;that I &#383;peak of every thing demoli&#383;hed,
and of nothing replaced. But it is not my fault&mdash;"If freedom
grows de&#383;tructive, I mu&#383;t paint it:" though I &#383;hould
tell you, that in many &#383;treets where convents have been
&#383;old, hou&#383;es are building with the materials on the
&#383;ame &#383;ite.&mdash;This is, however, not a work of the
nation, but of individuals, who have made their purcha&#383;es
cheap, and are ha&#383;tening to change the form of their property,
le&#383;t &#383;ome new revolution &#383;hould deprive them of
it.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Arras, September.</h2>
<p>Nothing more powerfully excites the attention of a &#383;tranger
on his fir&#383;t arrival, than the number and wretchedne&#383;s of
the poor at Arras. In all places poverty claims compul&#383;ion,
but here compa&#383;&#383;ion is accompanied by horror&mdash;one
dares not contemplate the object one commi&#383;erates, and charity
relieves with an averted eye. Perhaps with Him, who regard&#383;
equally the forlorn beggar &#383;tretched on the thre&#383;hold,
con&#383;umed by filth and di&#383;ea&#383;e, and the blooming
beauty who avoids while &#383;he &#383;uccours him, the offering of
humanity &#383;carcely expiates the involuntary di&#383;gu&#383;t;
yet &#383;uch is the weakne&#383;s of our nature, that there
exi&#383;ts a degree of mi&#383;ery again&#383;t which one's
&#383;en&#383;es are not proof, and benevolence it&#383;elf
revolt&#383; at the appearance of the poor of
Arras.&mdash;The&#383;e are not the cold and fa&#383;tidious
reflections of an unfeeling mind&mdash;they are not made without
pain: nor have I often felt the want of riches and con&#383;equence
&#383;o much a&#383; in my incapacity to promote &#383;ome means of
permanent and &#383;ub&#383;tantial remedy for the evils I have
been de&#383;cribing. I have frequently enquired the cau&#383;e of
this &#383;ingular mi&#383;ery, but can only learn that it always
ha&#383; been &#383;o. I fear it is, that the poor are without
energy, and the rich without genero&#383;ity. The decay of
manufactures &#383;ince the la&#383;t century mu&#383;t have
reduced many families to indigence. The&#383;e have been able to
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;t on the refu&#383;e of luxury, but, too
&#383;upine for exertion, they have &#383;ought for nothing more;
while the great, di&#383;charging their con&#383;cience&#383; with
the &#383;uperfluity of what admini&#383;tered to their pride,
fo&#383;tered the evil, in&#383;tead of endeavouring to remedy it.
But the benevolence of the French is not often active, nor
exten&#383;ive; it is more frequently a religious duty than a
&#383;entiment. They content them&#383;elves with affording a mere
exi&#383;tence to wretchedne&#383;s; and are almo&#383;t
&#383;trangers to tho&#383;e enlightened and generous efforts which
act beyond the moment, and &#383;eek not only to relieve poverty,
but to bani&#383;h it. Thus, through the frigid and indolent
charity of the rich, the mi&#383;ery which was at fir&#383;t
accidental is perpetuated, beggary and idlene&#383;s become
habitual, and are tran&#383;mitted, like more fortunate
inheritances, from one generation to another.&mdash;This is not a
mere conjecture&mdash;I have li&#383;tened to the
hi&#383;torie&#383; of many of the&#383;e unhappy outca&#383;ts,
who were more than thirty years old, and they have all told me,
they were born in the &#383;tate in which I beheld them, and that
they did not remember to have heard that their parent&#383; were in
any other. The National A&#383;&#383;embly profe&#383;s to
effectuate an entire regeneration of the country, and to eradicate
all evils, moral, phy&#383;ical, and political. I heartily
wi&#383;h the numerous and mi&#383;erable poor, with which Arras
abounds, may become one of the fir&#383;t objects of reform; and
that a nation which boa&#383;ts it&#383;elf the mo&#383;t
poli&#383;hed, the mo&#383;t powerful, and the mo&#383;t
philo&#383;ophic in the world, may not offer to the view &#383;o
many objects &#383;hocking to humanity.</p>
<p>The citadel of Arras is very &#383;trong, and, as I am told, the
chef d'oeuvre of Vauban; but placed with &#383;o little judgement,
that the military call it <i>la belle inutile</i> [the
u&#383;ele&#383;s beauty]. It is now uninhabited, and wears an
appearance of de&#383;olation&mdash;the commandant and all the
officers of the ancient government having been forced to abandon
it; their hou&#383;e&#383; al&#383;o are much damaged, and the
gardens entirely de&#383;troyed.&mdash;I never heard that this
popular commotion had any other motive than the general war of the
new doctrines on the old.</p>
<p>I am &#383;orry to &#383;ee that mo&#383;t of the volunteers who
go to join the army are either old men or boys, tempted by
extraordinary pay and &#383;carcity of employ. A cobler who has
been u&#383;ed to rear canary-birds for Mad. de ____, brought us
this morning all the birds he was po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of,
and told us he was going to-morrow to the frontiers. We a&#383;ked
him why, at hi&#383; age, he &#383;hould think of joining the army.
He &#383;aid, he had already &#383;erved, and that there were a few
months unexpired of the time that would entitle him to his
pen&#383;ion.&mdash;"Yes; but in the mean while you may get killed;
and then of what &#383;ervice will your claim to a pen&#383;ion
be?"&mdash; <i>"N'ayez pas peur, Madame&mdash;Je me menagerai
bien&mdash;on ne &#383;e bat pas pour ce&#383; gueux la comme pour
&#383;on Roi."</i>*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* "No fear of that, Madam&mdash;I'll take good care of
my&#383;elf: a man doe&#383; not fight for &#383;uch beggarly
ra&#383;cals as the&#383;e as he would for hi&#383;
King."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>M. de ____ is ju&#383;t returned from the camp of Maulde, where
he has been to &#383;ee his &#383;on. He &#383;ays, there is great
di&#383;order and want of di&#383;cipline, and that by &#383;ome
means or other the common &#383;oldiers abound more in money, and
game higher, than their officers. There are two young women,
inhabitants of the town of St. Amand, who go con&#383;tantly out on
all &#383;kirmi&#383;hing parties, exerci&#383;e daily with the
men, and have killed &#383;everal of the enemy. They are both
pretty&mdash;one only &#383;ixteen, the other a year or two older.
Mr. de ____ &#383;aw them as they were ju&#383;t returning from a
reconnoitring party. Perhaps I ought to have been a&#383;hamed
after thi&#383; recital to decline an invitation from Mr. de R___'s
&#383;on to dine with him at the camp; but I cannot but feel that I
am an extreme coward, and that I &#383;hould eat with no appetite
in &#383;ight of an Au&#383;trian army. The very idea of the&#383;e
modern Camillas terrifies me&mdash;their creation &#383;eems an
error of nature.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Their name was Fernig; they were natives of St.
Amand, and of no remarkable origin. They followed Dumouriez into
Flanders, where they &#383;ignalized them&#383;elves greatly, and
became Aides-de-Camp to that General. At the time of his defection,
one of them was &#383;hot by a &#383;oldier, who&#383;e regiment
&#383;he was endeavouring to gain over. Their hou&#383;e having
been razed by the Au&#383;trians at the beginning of the war, was
rebuilt at the expence of the nation; but, upon their participation
in Dumouriez' treachery, a &#383;econd decree of the
A&#383;&#383;embly again levelled it with the ground.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Our ho&#383;t, who&#383;e politene&#383;s is indefatigable,
accompanied us a few day&#383; ago to St. Eloy, a large and
magnificent abbey, about &#383;ix miles from Arras. It is built on
a terrace, which commands the &#383;urrounding country as far as
Douay; and I think I counted an hundred and fifty &#383;teps from
the hou&#383;e to the bottom of the garden, which is on a level
with the road. The cloi&#383;ters are paved with marble, and the
church neat and beautiful beyond de&#383;cription. The iron work of
the choir imitates flowers and foliage with &#383;o much ta&#383;te
and delicacy, that (but for the colour) one would rather
&#383;uppo&#383;e it to be &#383;oil, than any durable
material.&mdash;The monk&#383; &#383;till remain, and although the
decree has pa&#383;&#383;ed for their &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion,
they cannot &#383;uppo&#383;e it will take place. They are
mo&#383;tly old men, and, though I am no friend to the&#383;e
in&#383;titutions, they were &#383;o polite and ho&#383;pitable
that I could not help wi&#383;hing they were permitted, according
to the de&#383;ign of the fir&#383;t A&#383;&#383;embly, to die in
their habitation&#383;&mdash; e&#383;pecially as the &#383;ituation
of St. Eloy renders the building u&#383;ele&#383;s for any other
purpo&#383;e.&mdash;A friend of Mr. de ____ has a charming
country-hou&#383;e near the abbey, which he has been obliged to
deny him&#383;elf the enjoyment of, during the greate&#383;t part
of the &#383;ummer; for whenever the family return to Arras, their
per&#383;ons and their carriage are &#383;earched at the gate, as
&#383;trictly as though they were &#383;mugglers ju&#383;t arrived
from the coa&#383;t, under the pretence that they may
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t the religious of St. Eloy in &#383;ecuring
&#383;ome of their property, previous to the final
&#383;eizure.</p>
<p>I ob&#383;erve, in walking the &#383;treets here, that the
common people &#383;till retain much of the Spani&#383;h ca&#383;t
of features: the women are remarkably plain, and appear &#383;till
more &#383;o by wearing faals. The faal is about two ells of black
&#383;ilk or &#383;tuff, which is hung, without ta&#383;te or form,
on the head, and is extremely unbecoming: but it is worn only by
the lower cla&#383;s, or by the aged and devotees.</p>
<p>I am a very voluminous corre&#383;pondent, but if I tire you, it
is a proper puni&#383;hment for your in&#383;incerity in
de&#383;iring me to continue &#383;o. I have heard of a governor of
one of our We&#383;t India i&#383;lands who was univer&#383;ally
dete&#383;ted by its inhabitants, but who, on going to England,
found no difficulty in procuring addre&#383;&#383;es
expre&#383;&#383;ive of approbation and e&#383;teem. The
con&#383;equence was, he came back and continued governor for
life.&mdash;Do you make the application of my anecdote, and I
&#383;hall per&#383;evere in &#383;cribbling.&mdash;Every

<h2>Arras.</h2>
<p>It is not fa&#383;hionable at pre&#383;ent to frequent any
public place; but as we are &#383;trangers, and of no party, we
often pa&#383;s our evenings at the theatre. I am fond of
it&mdash;not &#383;o much on account of the repre&#383;entation, as
of the opportunity which it affords for ob&#383;erving the
di&#383;po&#383;itions of the people, and the bias intended to be
given them. The &#383;tage is now become a kind of political
&#383;chool, where the people are taught hatred to Kings, Nobility,
and Clergy, according as the per&#383;ecution of the moment
requires; and, I think, one may often judge from new pieces the
meditated &#383;acrifice. A year ago, all the &#383;ad catalogue of
human errors were per&#383;onified in Counts and
Marqui&#383;&#383;es; they were not repre&#383;ented a&#383;
individuals whom wealth and power had made &#383;omething too
proud, and much too luxurious, but as an order of mon&#383;ters,
who&#383;e exi&#383;tence, independently of their characters, was a
crime, and who&#383;e hereditary po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ions
alone implied a guilt, not to be expiated but by the forfeiture of
them. This, you will &#383;ay, was not very judicious; and that by
e&#383;tabli&#383;hing a &#383;ort of incompatibility of virtue
with titular di&#383;tinctions, the odium was tran&#383;ferred from
the living to the dead&mdash;from tho&#383;e who
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed the&#383;e di&#383;tinctions to
tho&#383;e who in&#383;tituted them. But, unfortunately, the French
were di&#383;po&#383;ed to find their noble&#383;&#383;e culpable,
and to reject every thing which tended to excu&#383;e or favour
them. The hauteur of the noble&#383;&#383;e acted as a fatal
equivalent to every other crime; and many, who did not credit other
imputations, rejoiced in the humiliation of their pride. The
people, the rich merchants, and even the le&#383;&#383;er gentry,
all eagerly concurred in the de&#383;truction of an order that had
di&#383;dained or excluded them; and, perhaps, of all the
innovation&#383; which have taken place, the abolition of rank has
excited the lea&#383;t intere&#383;t.</p>
<p>It is now le&#383;s nece&#383;&#383;ary to blacken the
noble&#383;&#383;e, and the compo&#383;itions of the day are
directed again&#383;t the Throne, the Clergy, and Mona&#383;tic
Orders. All the tyrants of pa&#383;t ages are brought from the
&#383;helves of faction and pedantry, and a&#383;&#383;imilated to
the mild and circum&#383;cribed monarchs of modern Europe. The
doctrine of popular &#383;overeignty is artfully in&#383;tilled,
and the people are &#383;timulated to exert a power which they
mu&#383;t implicitly delegate to tho&#383;e who have duped and
mi&#383;led them. The frenzy of a mob is repre&#383;ented as the
&#383;ublime&#383;t effort of patrioti&#383;m; and ambition and
revenge, u&#383;urping the title of national ju&#383;tice, immolate
their victims with applau&#383;e. The tendency of &#383;uch pieces
is too obvious; and they may, perhaps, &#383;ucceed in
familiarizing the minds of the people to events which, a few months
ago, would have filled them with horror. There are al&#383;o
numerous theatrical exhibitions, preparatory to the removal of the
nuns from their convents, and to the bani&#383;hment of the
prie&#383;ts. Ancient prejudices are not yet obliterated, and I
believe &#383;ome pains have been taken to ju&#383;tify the&#383;e
per&#383;ecutions by calumny. The hi&#383;tory of our
di&#383;&#383;olution of the mona&#383;teries has been
ran&#383;acked for &#383;candal, and the bigotry and bia&#383;es of
all countries are reduced into ab&#383;tracts, and expo&#383;ed on
the &#383;tage. The mo&#383;t implacable revenge, the mo&#383;t
refined malice, the extremes of avarice and cruelty, are wrought
into tragedies, and di&#383;played as acting under the ma&#383;k of
religion and the impunity of a cloi&#383;ter; while operas and
farces, with ridicule &#383;till more &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful,
exhibit convents as the abode of licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s,
intrigue, and &#383;uper&#383;tition.</p>
<p>The&#383;e efforts have been &#383;ufficiently
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful&mdash;not from the merit of the pieces,
but from the novelty of the &#383;ubject. The people in general
were &#383;trangers to the interior of convents: they beheld them
with that kind of re&#383;pect which is u&#383;ually produced in
uninformed minds by my&#383;tery and prohibition. Even the
mona&#383;tic habit was &#383;acred from dramatic u&#383;es;
&#383;o that a repre&#383;entation of cloi&#383;ters, monks, and
nuns, their co&#383;tume&#383; and manners, never fails to attract
the multitude.&mdash;But the &#383;ame cau&#383;e which renders
them curious, makes them credulous. Tho&#383;e who have &#383;een
no farther than the Grille, and tho&#383;e who have been educated
in convents, are equally unqualified to judge of the lives of the
religious; and their minds, having no internal conviction or
knowledge of the truth, ea&#383;ily become the converts of
&#383;lander and fal&#383;ehood.</p>
<p>I cannot help thinking, that there is &#383;omething mean and
cruel in thi&#383; procedure. If policy demand the &#383;acrifice,
it does not require that the victims &#383;hould be rendered
odious; and if it be nece&#383;&#383;ary to
di&#383;po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383; them of their habitations, they
ought not, at the moment they are thrown upon the world, to be
painted as mon&#383;ters unworthy of its pity or protection. It is
the cowardice of the a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in, who murders
before he dares to rob.</p>
<p>This cu&#383;tom of making public amu&#383;ements
&#383;ub&#383;ervient to party, has, I doubt not, much contributed
to the de&#383;truction of all again&#383;t whom it ha&#383; been
employed; and theatrical calumny &#383;eems to be always the
harbinger of approaching ruin to its object; yet this is not the
greate&#383;t evil which may ari&#383;e from the&#383;e
in&#383;idious politic&#383;&mdash;they are equally unfavourable
both to the morals and ta&#383;te of the people; the fir&#383;t are
injured beyond calculation, and the latter corrupted beyond
amendment. The orders of &#383;ociety, which formerly in&#383;pired
re&#383;pect or veneration, are now deba&#383;ed and exploded; and
mankind, once taught to &#383;ee nothing but vice and
hypocri&#383;y in tho&#383;e whom they had been accu&#383;tomed to
regard as models of virtue, are ea&#383;ily led to doubt the very
exi&#383;tence of virtue it&#383;elf: they know not where to turn
for either in&#383;truction or example; no pro&#383;pect i&#383;
offered to them but the dreary and uncomfortable view of general
depravity; and the individual is no longer encouraged to
&#383;truggle with vicious propen&#383;ities, when he concludes
them irre&#383;i&#383;tibly inherent in hi&#383; nature. Perhaps it
was not po&#383;&#383;ible to imagine principles at once &#383;o
&#383;eductive and ruinous as tho&#383;e now
di&#383;&#383;eminated. How are the morals of the people to
re&#383;i&#383;t a doctrine which teaches them that the rich only
can be criminal, and that poverty is a &#383;ub&#383;titute for
virtue&mdash;that wealth i&#383; holden by the &#383;ufferance of
tho&#383;e who do not po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s it&mdash;and that he
who is the frequenter of a club, or the applauder of a party, is
exempt from the duties of his &#383;tation, and has a right to
in&#383;ult and oppre&#383;s hi&#383; fellow citizens? All the
weakne&#383;&#383;es of humanity are flattered and called to the
aid of this pernicious &#383;y&#383;tem of revolutionary ethics;
and if France yet continue in a &#383;tate of civilization, it is
becau&#383;e Providence has not yet abandoned her to the influence
of &#383;uch a &#383;y&#383;tem.</p>
<p>Ta&#383;te is, I repeat it, as little a gainer by the revolution
as morals. The pieces which were be&#383;t calculated to form and
refine the minds of the people, all abound with maxims of loyalty,
with re&#383;pect for religion, and the &#383;ubordinations of
civil &#383;ociety. The&#383;e are all prohibited; and are replaced
by fu&#383;tian declamations, tending to promote anarchy and
di&#383;cord &mdash;by vulgar and immoral farces, and
in&#383;idious and flattering panegyric&#383; on the vices of low
life. No drama can &#383;ucceed that is not &#383;upported by the
faction; and this &#383;upport is to be procured only by vilifying
the Throne, the Clergy, and Noble&#383;&#383;e. This is a
&#383;uccedaneum for literary merit, and tho&#383;e who
di&#383;approve are menaced into &#383;ilence; while the multitude,
who do not judge but imitate, applaud with their
leader&#383;&mdash;and thus all their ideas become vitiated, and
imbibe the corruption of their favourite amu&#383;ement.</p>
<p>I have dwelt on this &#383;ubject longer than I intended; but as
I would not be &#383;uppo&#383;ed prejudiced nor precipitate in my
a&#383;&#383;ertions, I will, by the fir&#383;t occa&#383;ion,
&#383;end you &#383;ome of the mo&#383;t popular farces and
tragedies: you may then decide your&#383;elf upon the tendency;
and, by comparing the di&#383;po&#383;itions of the French before,
and within, the la&#383;t two years, you may al&#383;o determine
whether or not my conclu&#383;ions are warranted by fact.
Adieu.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Arras.</h2>
<p>Our countrymen who vi&#383;it France for the fir&#383;t
time&mdash;their imagination&#383; filled with the epithets which
the vanity of one nation has appropriated, and the indulgence of
the other &#383;anctioned&mdash;are a&#383;toni&#383;hed to find
thi&#383; "land of elegance," this refined people, extremely
inferior to the Engli&#383;h in all the arts that mini&#383;ter to
the comfort and accommodation of life. They are &#383;urprized to
feel them&#383;elves &#383;tarved by the intru&#383;ion of all the
winds of heaven, or &#383;mothered by volumes of
&#383;moke&mdash;that no lock will either open or
&#383;hut&mdash;that the drawers are all immoveable&mdash;and that
neither chairs nor tables can be pre&#383;erved in equilibrium. In
vain do they inquire for a thou&#383;and conveniences which to them
&#383;eem indi&#383;pen&#383;ible; they are not to be procured, or
even their u&#383;e is unknown: till at length, after a
re&#383;idence in a &#383;core of hou&#383;es, in all of which they
ob&#383;erve the &#383;ame deficiencies, they begin to grow
&#383;ceptical, to doubt the pretended &#383;uperiority of France,
and, perhaps for the fir&#383;t time, do ju&#383;tice to their own
una&#383;&#383;uming country. It mu&#383;t however, be
confe&#383;&#383;ed, that if the chimnies &#383;moke, they are
u&#383;ually &#383;urrounded by marble&mdash;that the un&#383;table
chair is often covered with &#383;ilk&mdash;and that if a room be
cold, it is plentifully decked with gilding, pictures, and
gla&#383;&#383;es.&mdash;In &#383;hort, a French hou&#383;e is
generally more &#383;howy than convenient, and &#383;eldom conveys
that idea of dome&#383;tic comfort which con&#383;titutes the
luxury of an Engli&#383;hman.</p>
<p>I ob&#383;erve, that the mo&#383;t prevailing ornaments here are
family portraits: almo&#383;t every dwelling, even among the lower
kind of trade&#383;men, is peopled with the&#383;e en&#383;igns of
vanity; and the painters employed on the&#383;e occa&#383;ions,
however deficient in other requi&#383;ites of their art, &#383;eem
to have an unfortunate knack at pre&#383;erving
likene&#383;&#383;es. Heads powdered even whiter than the
originals, laced wai&#383;tcoats, enormous lappets, and
countenances all ingeniou&#383;ly di&#383;po&#383;ed &#383;o as to
&#383;mile at each other, encumber the wain&#383;cot, and
di&#383;tre&#383;s the unlucky vi&#383;itor, who is obliged to bear
te&#383;timony to the re&#383;emblance. When one &#383;ees whole
rooms filled with the&#383;e figures, one cannot help reflecting on
the goodne&#383;s of Providence, which thus di&#383;tributes
&#383;elf-love, in proportion as it denie&#383; tho&#383;e gifts
that excite the admiration of others.</p>
<p>You mu&#383;t not under&#383;tand what I have &#383;aid on the
furniture of French hou&#383;es as applying to tho&#383;e of the
nobility or people of extraordinary fortunes, becau&#383;e they are
enabled to add the conveniences of other countries to the luxuries
of their own. Yet even the&#383;e, in my opinion, have not the
uniform elegance of an Engli&#383;h habitation: there is
alway&#383; &#383;ome di&#383;parity between the workman&#383;hip
and the material&#383;&mdash;&#383;ome mixture of &#383;plendour
and clum&#383;ine&#383;s, and a want of what the painters call
keeping; but the hou&#383;es of the gentry, the le&#383;&#383;er
noble&#383;&#383;e, and merchants, are, for the mo&#383;t part, as
I have de&#383;cribed&mdash;-abounding in &#383;ilk, marble,
gla&#383;&#383;es, and pictures; but ill fini&#383;hed, dirty, and
deficient in article&#383; of real u&#383;e.&mdash;I &#383;hould,
however, notice, that genteel people are cleaner here than in the
interior parts of the kingdom. The floors are in general of oak, or
&#383;ometimes of brick; but they are always rubbed bright, and
have not that filthy appearance which &#383;o often
di&#383;gu&#383;ts one in French hou&#383;es.</p>
<p>The heads of the lower cla&#383;&#383;es of people are much
di&#383;turbed by the&#383;e new principles of univer&#383;al
equality. We enquired of a man we &#383;aw near a coach this
morning if it was hired. "Mon&#383;ieur&mdash;(quoth he&mdash;then
checking him&#383;elf &#383;uddenly,)&mdash;no, I forgot, I ought
not to &#383;ay Mon&#383;ieur, for they tell me I am equal to any
body in the world: yet, after all, I know not well if this may be
true; and as I have drunk out all I am worth, I believe I had
better go home and begin work again to-morrow." This new
di&#383;ciple of equality had, indeed, all the appearance of having
&#383;acrificed to the &#383;ucce&#383;s of the cau&#383;e, and was
then recovering from a dream of greatne&#383;s which he told us had
la&#383;ted two days.</p>
<p>Since the day of taking the new oath we have met many equally
elevated, though le&#383;s civil. Some are undoubtedly paid, but
others will di&#383;tre&#383;&#383; their families for weeks by
this celebration of their new di&#383;coveries, and mu&#383;t,
after all, like our intoxicated philo&#383;opher, be obliged to
return "to work again to-morrow."</p>
<p>I mu&#383;t now bid you adieu&mdash;and, in doing &#383;o,
naturally turn my thoughts to that country where the rights of the
people con&#383;i&#383;t not of &#383;terile and metaphy&#383;ic
declarations, but of real defence and protection. May they for ever
remain uninterrupted by the deva&#383;tating chimeras of their
neighbours; and if they &#383;eek reform, may it be moderate and
permanent, acceded to rea&#383;on, and not extorted by
violence!&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>September 2, 1792.</h2>
<p>We were &#383;o much alarmed at the theatre on Thur&#383;day,
that I believe we &#383;hall not venture again to amu&#383;e
our&#383;elves at the ri&#383;k of a &#383;imilar occurrence. About
the middle of the piece, a violent outcry began from all parts of
the hou&#383;e, and &#383;eemed to be directed again&#383;t our
box; and I perceived Madame Duchene, the Pre&#383;idente of the
Jacobins, heading the legions of Paradi&#383;e with peculiar
animation. You may imagine we were not a little terrified. I
anxiou&#383;ly examined the dre&#383;s of my&#383;elf and my
companions, and ob&#383;erving nothing that could offend the
affected &#383;implicity of the times, prepared to quit the
hou&#383;e. A friendly voice, however, exerting it&#383;elf above
the clamour, informed us that the offen&#383;ive objects were a
cloak and a &#383;hawl which hung over the front of the
box.&mdash;You will &#383;carcely &#383;uppo&#383;e &#383;uch
gro&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s po&#383;&#383;ible among a civilized
people; but the fact is, our friends are of the pro&#383;cribed
cla&#383;s, and we were in&#383;ulted becau&#383;e in their
&#383;ociety.&mdash;I have before noticed, that the guards which
were &#383;tationed in the theatre before the revolution are now
removed, and a municipal officer, made con&#383;picuous by his
&#383;carf, is placed in the middle front box, and, in ca&#383;e of
any tumult, is empowered to call in the military to his
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance.</p>
<p>We have this morning been vi&#383;iting two objects, which
exhibit thi&#383; country in very different points of view&mdash;as
the &#383;eat of wealth, and the abode of poverty. The fir&#383;t
is the abbey of St. Vaa&#383;t, a mo&#383;t &#383;uperb pile, now
inhabited by monks of various orders, but who are preparing to quit
it, in obedience to the late decrees. Nothing impre&#383;&#383;es
one with a &#383;tronger idea of the influence of the Clergy, than
the&#383;e &#383;plendid edifices. We &#383;ee them reared
amid&#383;t the &#383;olitude of de&#383;erts, and in the gaiety
and mi&#383;ery of cities; and while they cheer the one and
embelli&#383;h the other, they exhibit, in both, monuments of
indefatigable labour and immen&#383;e wealth.&mdash;The facade of
St. Vaa&#383;t is &#383;imple and &#383;triking, and the
cloi&#383;ters and every other part of the building are extremely
hand&#383;ome. The library is &#383;uppo&#383;ed to be the
fine&#383;t in France, except the King's, but is now under the
&#383;eal of the nation. A young monk, who was our Cicerone, told
us he was &#383;orry it was not in his power to &#383;how it.
<i>"Et nous, Mon&#383;ieur, nous &#383;ommes faches
au&#383;&#383;i."</i>&mdash;["And we are not le&#383;s &#383;orry
than your&#383;elf, Sir."]</p>
<p>Thus, with the aid of &#383;ignificant looks, and ge&#383;tures
of di&#383;approbation, an exchange of &#383;entiments took place,
without a &#383;ingle expre&#383;&#383;ion of trea&#383;onable
import: both parties under&#383;tood perfectly well, that in
regretting that the library was inacce&#383;&#383;ible, each
included all the circum&#383;tances which attended it.&mdash;A new
church was building in a &#383;tyle worthy of the convent&mdash;I
think, near four hundred feet long; but it wa&#383;
di&#383;continued at the &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion of the
religious orders, and will now, of cour&#383;e, never be
fini&#383;hed.</p>
<p>From this abode of learned ca&#383;e and pious indolence Mr. de
____ conducted us to the Mont de Piete, a national in&#383;titution
for lending money to the poor on pledges, (at a moderate
intere&#383;t,) which, if not redeemed within a year, are &#383;old
by auction, and the overplus, if there remain any, after deducting
the intere&#383;t, is given to the owner of the pledge.
Thou&#383;and&#383; of &#383;mall packets are depo&#383;ited here,
which, to the eye of affluence, might &#383;eem the very
refu&#383;e of beggary it&#383;elf.&mdash;I could not reflect
without an heart-ache, on the di&#383;tre&#383;s of the individual,
thus driven to relinqui&#383;h his la&#383;t covering, braving cold
to &#383;ati&#383;fy hunger, and accumulating wretchedne&#383;s by
momentary relief. I &#383;aw, in a lower room, groupes of
unfortunate beings, depriving them&#383;elves of different parts of
their apparel, and watching with &#383;olicitude the arbitrary
valuations; others exchanging &#383;ome article of
nece&#383;&#383;ity for one of a &#383;till greater&mdash;
&#383;ome in a &#383;tate of intoxication, uttering execrations of
de&#383;pair; and all exhibiting a picture of human nature depraved
and mi&#383;erable.&mdash;While I wa&#383; viewing this &#383;cene,
I recalled the magnificent building we had ju&#383;t left, and my
fir&#383;t emotions were tho&#383;e of regret and cen&#383;ure.
When we only feel, and have not lei&#383;ure to reflect, we are
indignant that va&#383;t &#383;um&#383; &#383;hould be expended on
&#383;umptuous edifices, and that the poor &#383;hould live in vice
and want; yet the erection of St. Vaa&#383;t mu&#383;t have
maintained great numbers of indu&#383;trious hands; and perhaps the
revenues of the abbey may not, under its new
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ors, be &#383;o well employed. When the
offerings and the tributes to religion are the &#383;upport of the
indu&#383;triou&#383; poor, it is their be&#383;t appropriation;
and he who gives labour for a day, is a more u&#383;eful benefactor
than he who maintains in idlene&#383;s for two. &mdash;I could not
help wi&#383;hing that the poor might no longer be tempted by the
facility of a re&#383;ource, which perhaps, in mo&#383;t
in&#383;tances, only increa&#383;es their
di&#383;tre&#383;s.&mdash;It is an injudicious expedient to
palliate an evil, which great national works, and the encouragement
of indu&#383;try and manufactures, might eradicate.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* In times of public commotion people frequently
&#383;end their valuable effects to the Mont de Piete, not only as
being &#383;ecure by it&#383; &#383;trength, but as it is
re&#383;pected by the people, who are intere&#383;ted in its
pre&#383;ervation.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;With the&#383;e reflections I concluded mental peace with
the monks of St. Vaa&#383;t, and would, had it depended upon me,
have readily comprized the fini&#383;hing their great church in the
treaty.</p>
<p>The Primary A&#383;&#383;emblies have already taken place in
this department. We happened to enter a church while the young
Robe&#383;pierre was haranguing to an audience, very little
re&#383;pectable either in numbers or appearance. They were,
however, &#383;ufficiently unanimous, and made up in noi&#383;y
applau&#383;e what they wanted in other re&#383;pects. If the
electors and elected of other departments be of the &#383;ame
complexion with tho&#383;e of Arras, the new A&#383;&#383;embly
will not, in any re&#383;pect, be preferable to the old one. I have
reproached many of the people of this place, who, from their
education and property, have a right to take an intere&#383;t in
the public affairs, with thus &#383;uffering them&#383;elves to be
repre&#383;ented by the mo&#383;t de&#383;perate and worthle&#383;s
individuals of the town. Their defence is, that they are
in&#383;ulted and overpowered if they attend the popular meetings,
and by electing <i>"les gueux et les &#383;celerats pour
deputes,"</i>* they &#383;end them to Paris, and &#383;ecure their
own local tranquillity.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The &#383;crubs and &#383;coundrels for
deputies.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;The fir&#383;t of the&#383;e a&#383;&#383;ertions is but
too true, yet I cannot but think the &#383;econd a very dangerous
experiment. They remove the&#383;e turbulent and needy adventurers
from the direction of a club to that of government, and procure a
partial relief by contributing to the general ruin.</p>
<p>Paris is &#383;aid to be in extreme fermentation, and we are in
&#383;ome anxiety for our friend M. P____, who was to go there from
Montmorency la&#383;t week. I &#383;hall not clo&#383;e my letter
till I have heard from him.</p>

<h2>September 4.</h2>
<p>I re&#383;ume my pen after a &#383;leeple&#383;s night, and with
an oppre&#383;&#383;ion of mind not to be de&#383;cribed. Paris is
the &#383;cene of pro&#383;cription and ma&#383;&#383;acres. The
pri&#383;oners, the clergy, the noble&#383;&#383;e, all that are
&#383;uppo&#383;ed inimical to public faction, or the objects of
private revenge, are &#383;acrificed without mercy. We are here in
the utmo&#383;t terror and con&#383;ternation&mdash;we know not the
end nor the extent of the&#383;e horrors, and every one i&#383;
anxious for him&#383;elf or his friends. Our &#383;ociety
con&#383;i&#383;ts mo&#383;tly of females, and we do not venture
out, but hover together like the fowls of heaven, when warned by a
vague yet in&#383;tinctive dread of the approaching &#383;torm. We
tremble at the &#383;ound of voices in the &#383;treet, and cry,
with the agitation of Macbeth, "there's knocking at the gate." I do
not indeed envy, but I mo&#383;t &#383;incerely regret, the peace
and &#383;afety of England.&mdash;I have no courage to add more,
but will enclo&#383;e a ha&#383;ty tran&#383;lation of the letter
we received from M. P____, by la&#383;t night'&#383; po&#383;t.
Humanity cannot comment upon it without &#383;huddering.&mdash;Ever
Yours, &amp;c.</p>
<p>"Rue St. Honore, Sept. 2, 1792.</p>
<p>"In a moment like this, I &#383;hould be ea&#383;ily
excu&#383;ed a breach of promi&#383;e in not writing; yet when I
recollect the apprehen&#383;ion which the kindne&#383;s of my
amiable friends will feel on my account, I determine, even
amid&#383;t the danger and de&#383;olation that &#383;urround me,
to relieve them.&mdash;Would to Heaven I had nothing more alarming
to communicate than my own &#383;ituation! I may indeed &#383;uffer
by accident; but thou&#383;ands of wretched victims are at
thi&#383; moment marked for &#383;acrifice, and are
ma&#383;&#383;acred with an execrable imitation of rule and order:
a ferocious and cruel multitude, headed by cho&#383;en
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins, are attacking the pri&#383;ons,
forcing the hou&#383;es of the noble&#383;&#383;e and prie&#383;ts,
and, after a horrid mockery of judicial condemnation, execute them
on the &#383;pot. The toc&#383;in is rung, alarm gun&#383; are
fired, the &#383;treets re&#383;ound with fearful &#383;hrieks, and
an undefinable &#383;en&#383;ation of terror &#383;eizes on one's
heart. I feel that I have committed an imprudence in venturing to
Paris; but the barriers are now &#383;hut, and I mu&#383;t abide
the event. I know not to what the&#383;e pro&#383;criptions tend,
or if all who are not their advocates are to be their victims; but
an ungovernable rage animates the people: many of them have papers
in their hands that &#383;eem to direct them to their objects, to
whom they hurry in crouds with an eager and &#383;avage
fury.&mdash;I have ju&#383;t been obliged to quit my pen. A cart
had &#383;topped near my lodgings, and my ears were
a&#383;&#383;ailed by the groans of angui&#383;h, and the
&#383;houts of frantic exultation. Uncertain whether to
de&#383;cend or remain, I, after a moment's deliberation, concluded
it would be better to have &#383;hown my&#383;elf than to have
appeared to avoid it, in ca&#383;e the people &#383;hould enter the
hou&#383;e, and therefore went down with the be&#383;t &#383;how of
courage I could a&#383;&#383;ume.&mdash;I will draw a veil over the
&#383;cene that pre&#383;ented it&#383;elf&mdash;nature revolts,
and my fair friends would &#383;hudder at the detail. Suffice it to
&#383;ay, that I &#383;aw cars, loaded with the dead and dying, and
driven by their yet en&#383;anguined murderers; one of whom, in a
tone of exultation, cried, 'Here is a glorious day for France!' I
endeavoured to a&#383;&#383;ent, though with a faultering voice,
and, as &#383;oon as they were pa&#383;&#383;ed e&#383;caped to my
room. You may imagine I &#383;hall not ea&#383;ily recover the
&#383;hock I received.&mdash;At thi&#383; moment they &#383;ay, the
enemy are retreating from Verdun. At any other time this would have
been de&#383;irable, but at pre&#383;ent one knows not what to
wi&#383;h for. Mo&#383;t probably, the report is only &#383;pread
with the humane hope of appea&#383;ing the mob. They have already
twice attacked the Temple; and I tremble le&#383;t this a&#383;ylum
of fallen maje&#383;ty &#383;hould ere morning, be violated.</p>
<p>"Adieu&mdash;I know not if the courier will be permitted to
depart; but, as I believe the &#383;treets are not more un&#383;afe
than the hou&#383;es, I &#383;hall make an attempt to &#383;end
this. I will write again in a few days. If to-morrow &#383;hould
prove calm, I &#383;hall be engaged in enquiring after the fate of
my friends.&mdash;I beg my re&#383;pects to Mons. And Mad. de ____;
and entreat you all to be as tranquil as &#383;uch
circum&#383;tances will permit.&mdash;You may be certain of hearing
any news that can give you plea&#383;ure immediately. I have the
honour to be," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Arras, September, 1792.</h2>
<p>You will in future, I believe, find me but a dull
corre&#383;pondent. The natural timidity of my
di&#383;po&#383;ition, added to the dread which a native of England
has of any violation of dome&#383;tic &#383;ecurity, renders me
unfit for the &#383;cenes I am engaged in. I am become &#383;tupid
and melancholy, and my letters will partake of the
oppre&#383;&#383;ion of my mind.</p>
<p>At Paris, the ma&#383;&#383;acres at the pri&#383;ons are now
over, but tho&#383;e in the &#383;treets and in private hou&#383;es
&#383;till continue. Scarcely a po&#383;t arrive&#383; that does
not inform M. de ____ of &#383;ome friend or acquaintance being
&#383;acrificed. Heaven knows where this is to end!</p>
<p>We had, for two days, notice that, pur&#383;uant to a decree of
the A&#383;&#383;embly, commi&#383;&#383;ioners were expected here
at night, and that the toc&#383;in would be rung for every body to
deliver up their arms. We did not dare go to bed on either of
the&#383;e nights, but merely lay down in our robes de chambre,
without attempting to &#383;leep. This dreaded bu&#383;ine&#383;s
is, however, pa&#383;t. Parties of the Jacobins paraded the
&#383;treets ye&#383;terday morning, and di&#383;armed all they
thought proper. I ob&#383;erved they had li&#383;ts in their hands,
and only went to &#383;uch hou&#383;es as have an external
appearance of property. Mr. de ____, who has been in the
&#383;ervice thirty years, delivered his arms to a boy, who behaved
to him with the utmo&#383;t in&#383;olence, whil&#383;t we &#383;at
trembling and almo&#383;t &#383;en&#383;ele&#383;s with fear the
whole time they remained in the hou&#383;e; and could I give you an
idea of their appearance, you would think my terror very
ju&#383;tifiable. It is, indeed, &#383;trange and alarming, that
all who have property &#383;hould be deprived of the means of
defending either that or their lives, at a moment when Paris is
giving an example of tumult and a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination
to every other part of the kingdom. Knowing no good rea&#383;on for
&#383;uch procedure, it is very natural to &#383;u&#383;pect a bad
one.&mdash;I think, on many accounts, we are more expo&#383;ed here
than at ____, and as &#383;oon as we can procure hor&#383;es we
&#383;hall depart.&mdash;The following is the tran&#383;lation of
our la&#383;t letter from Mr. P____.</p>
<br />
<p>"I promi&#383;ed my kind friends to write as &#383;oon as I
&#383;hould have any thing &#383;ati&#383;factory to communicate:
but, ala&#383;! I have no hope of being the harbinger of any thing
but circum&#383;tances of a very different tendency. I can only
give you details of the horrors I have already generally
de&#383;cribed. Carnage has not yet cea&#383;ed; and is only become
more cool and more di&#383;criminating. All the mild
characteri&#383;tics annihilated; and a frantic cruelty, which is
dignified with the name of patrioti&#383;m, ha&#383; u&#383;urped
ever faculty, and bani&#383;hed both rea&#383;on and mercy.</p>
<p>"Mons. ____, whom I have hitherto known by reputation, as an
upright, and even humane man, had a brother &#383;hut up, with a
number of other prie&#383;ts, at the Carmes; and, by his
&#383;ituation and connections, he has &#383;uch influence as
might, if exerted, have pre&#383;erved the latter. The unfortunate
brother knowing this, found means, while hourly expecting hi&#383;
fate, to convey a note to Mr. ____, begging he would immediately
relea&#383;e, and procure him an a&#383;ylum. The
me&#383;&#383;enger returned with an an&#383;wer, that Mons. ____
had no relations in the enemies of his country!</p>
<p>"A few hours after, the ma&#383;&#383;acres at the Carmes took
place.&mdash;One Panis,* who is in the Comite de Surveillance, had,
a few days previous to the&#383;e dreadful events, become, I know
not on what occa&#383;ion, the depo&#383;itary of a large &#383;um
of money belonging to a gentleman of his &#383;ection.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Panis has &#383;ince figured on various
occa&#383;ions. He is a member of the Convention, and was openly
accu&#383;ed of having been an accomplice in the robbery of the
Garde Meuble.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"A &#383;ecret and frivolous denunciation was made the pretext
for throwing the owner of the money into pri&#383;on, where he
remained till September, when his friends, recollecting his danger,
flew to the Committee and applied for his di&#383;charge.
Unfortunately, the only member of the Committee pre&#383;ent was
Panis. He promi&#383;ed to take mea&#383;ures for an immediate
relea&#383;e.&mdash;Perhaps he kept his word, but the relea&#383;e
was cruel and final&mdash;the pri&#383;on was attacked, and the
victim heard of no more.&mdash;You will not be &#383;urprized at
&#383;uch occurrences when I tell you that G____,* whom you
mu&#383;t remember to have heard of as a Jacobin at ____, i&#383;
Pre&#383;ident of the Committee above mentioned&mdash;yes, an
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in is now the protector of the public
&#383;afety, and the commune of Paris the patron of a criminal who
has merited the gibbet.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* G____ was afterwards elected (doubtle&#383;s by a
recommendation of the Jacobins) Deputy for the department of
Fini&#383;terre, to which he wa&#383; &#383;ent
Commi&#383;&#383;ioner by the Convention. On account of &#383;ome
unwarrantable proceedings, and of &#383;ome words that e&#383;caped
him, which gave ri&#383;e to a &#383;u&#383;picion that he was
privy to the robbery of the Garde Meuble, he was arre&#383;ted by
the municipality of Quimper Corentin, of which place he is a
native. The Jacobins applied for his di&#383;charge, and for the
puni&#383;hment of the municipality; but the Convention, who at
that time rarely took any deci&#383;ive mea&#383;ures, ordered
G____ to be liberated, but evaded the other part of the petition
which tended to revenge him. The affair of the Garde Meuble, was,
however, again brought forward; but, mo&#383;t probably, many of
the members had rea&#383;ons for not di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing too
nearly the accu&#383;ation again&#383;t G____; and tho&#383;e who
were not intere&#383;ted in &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ing it, were too
weak or too timid to pur&#383;ue it farther.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"&mdash;I know not if we are yet arrived at the climax of woe
and iniquity, but Bri&#383;&#383;ot, Condorcet, Rolland, &amp;c.
and all tho&#383;e who&#383;e principles you have reprobated as
violent and dangerous, will now form the moderate &#383;ide of the
A&#383;&#383;embly. Perhaps even tho&#383;e who are now the party
mo&#383;t dreaded, may one day give place to yet more
de&#383;perate leaders, and become in their turn our be&#383;t
alternative. What will then be the &#383;ituation of France? Who
can reflect without trembling at the pro&#383;pect?&mdash;It is not
yet &#383;afe to walk the &#383;treets decently dre&#383;&#383;ed;
and I have been obliged to &#383;upply my&#383;elf with
trow&#383;ers, a jacket, coloured neckcloths, and coar&#383;e
linen, which I take care to &#383;oil before I venture out.</p>
<p>"The Agrarian law is now the moral of Paris, and I had nearly
lo&#383;t my life ye&#383;terday by tearing a placard written in
&#383;upport of it. I did it imprudently, not &#383;uppo&#383;ing I
was ob&#383;erved; and had not &#383;ome people, known as Jacobins,
come up and interfered in my behalf, the con&#383;equence might
have been fatal.&mdash;It would be difficult, and even
impo&#383;&#383;ible, to attempt a de&#383;cription of the manners
of the people of Paris at this moment: the licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s
common to great cities is decency compared with what prevails in
this; it has features of a peculiar and &#383;triking
de&#383;cription, and the general expre&#383;&#383;ion is that of a
mon&#383;trous union of oppo&#383;ite vices. Alternately
di&#383;&#383;olute and cruel, gay and vindictive, the
Pari&#383;ian vaunts amid&#383;t debauchery the triumph of
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination, and enlivens hi&#383; midnight
orgies by recounting the &#383;ufferings of the ma&#383;&#383;acred
ari&#383;tocrates: women, who&#383;e profe&#383;&#383;ion it is to
plea&#383;e, a&#383;&#383;ume the <i>bonnet rouge</i> [red cap],
and affect, as a means of &#383;eduction, an intrepid and ferocious
courage.&mdash;I cannot yet learn if Mons. S____'s &#383;i&#383;ter
be alive; her &#383;ituation about the Queen makes it too doubtful;
but endeavour to give him hope&mdash;many may have e&#383;caped
who&#383;e fears &#383;till detain them in concealment. People of
the fir&#383;t rank now inhabit garrets and cellars, and tho&#383;e
who appear are di&#383;gui&#383;ed beyond recollection; &#383;o
that I do not de&#383;pair of the &#383;afety of &#383;ome, who are
now thought to have peri&#383;hed.&mdash; I am, as you may
&#383;uppo&#383;e, in ha&#383;te to leave this place, and I hope to
return to Montmorency tomorrow; but every body is &#383;oliciting
pa&#383;&#383;ports. The Hotel de Ville is be&#383;ieged, and I
have already attended two day&#383; without
&#383;ucce&#383;s.&mdash;I beg my re&#383;pectful homage to
Mon&#383;ieur and Madame de ____; and I have the honour to be, with
e&#383;teem, the affectionate &#383;ervant of my friends in
general.</p>
<center>"L____."</center>
<p>You will read M. L____'s letter with all the grief and
indignation we have already felt, and I will make no comment on it,
but to give you a &#383;light &#383;ketch of the hi&#383;tory of
Guermeur, whom he mentions as being Pre&#383;ident of the Committee
of Surveillance.&mdash;In the ab&#383;ence of a man, whom he called
his friend, he &#383;educed his wife, and eloped with her: the
hu&#383;band overtook them, and fell in the di&#383;pute which
in&#383;ued; when Guermeur, to avoid being taken by the officers of
ju&#383;tice, abandoned hi&#383; companion to her fate, and
e&#383;caped alone. After a variety of adventures, he at length
enli&#383;ted him&#383;elf as a grenadier in the regiment of
Dillon. With much a&#383;&#383;urance, and talents cultivated above
the &#383;ituation in which he appeared, he became popular
among&#383;t his fellow-&#383;oldiers, and the military impunity,
which is one effect of the revolution, ca&#383;t a veil over his
former guilt, or rather indeed enabled him to defy the
puni&#383;hment annexed to it. When the regiment was quartered at
____, he frequented and harangued at the Jacobin club, perverted
the minds of the &#383;oldiers by &#383;editious
addre&#383;&#383;es, till at length he was deemed qualified to quit
the character of a &#383;ubordinate incendiary, and figure
among&#383;t the a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins at Paris. He had
hitherto, I believe, acted without pay, for he was deeply in debt,
and without money or clothes; but a few day&#383; previous to the
tenth of Augu&#383;t, a leader of the Jacobins &#383;upplied him
with both, paid his debts, procured his di&#383;charge, and
&#383;ent him to Paris. What intermediate gradations he may have
pa&#383;&#383;ed through, I know not; but it is not difficult to
imagine the &#383;ervices that have advanced him to hi&#383;
pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation.&mdash;It would be un&#383;afe to
ri&#383;k this letter by the po&#383;t, and I clo&#383;e it
ha&#383;tily to avail my&#383;elf of a pre&#383;ent
conveyance.&mdash;I remain, Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Arras, September 14, 1792.</h2>
<p>The camp of Maulde is broken up, and we deferred our journey,
that we might pa&#383;s a day at Douay with M. de ____'s &#383;on.
The road within &#383;ome miles of that place is covered with corn
and forage, the immediate environs are begun to be inundated, and
every thing wears the appearance of impending ho&#383;tility. The
town is &#383;o full of troops, that without the intere&#383;t of
our military friends we &#383;hould &#383;carcely have procured a
lodging. All was bu&#383;tle and confu&#383;ion, the enemy are very
near, and the French are preparing to form a camp under the walls.
Amid&#383;t all this, we found it difficult to &#383;ati&#383;fy
our curio&#383;ity in viewing the churches and pictures: &#383;ome
of the former are &#383;hut, and the latter concealed; we therefore
contented our&#383;elves with &#383;eeing the principal ones.</p>
<p>The town-hou&#383;e is a very hand&#383;ome building, where the
Parliament wa&#383; holden previous to the revolution, and where
all the bu&#383;ine&#383;s of the department of the North is now
tran&#383;acted.&mdash;In the council-chamber, which is very
elegantly carved, was al&#383;o a picture of the pre&#383;ent King.
They were, at the very moment of our entrance, in the act of
di&#383;placing it. We a&#383;ked the rea&#383;on, and were told it
was to be cut in pieces, and portions &#383;ent to the different
popular &#383;ocieties.&mdash;I know not if our features betrayed
the indignation we feared to expre&#383;s, but the man who
&#383;eemed to have directed this di&#383;po&#383;al of the
portrait, told us we were not Engli&#383;h if we &#383;aw it with
regret. I was not much delighted with &#383;uch a compliment to our
country, and was glad to e&#383;cape without farther comment.</p>
<p>The manners of the people &#383;eem every where much changed,
and are becoming gro&#383;s and inhuman. While we were walking on
the ramparts, I happened to have occa&#383;ion to take down an
addre&#383;s, and with the paper and pencil in my hand turned out
of the direct path to ob&#383;erve a chapel on one &#383;ide of it.
In a moment I was alarmed by the cries of my companions, and beheld
the mu&#383;quet of the centinel pointed at me, and M. de ____
expo&#383;tulating with him. I am not certain if he
&#383;uppo&#383;ed I was taking a plan of the fortifications, and
meant really more than a threat; but I wa&#383; &#383;ufficiently
frightened, and &#383;hall not again approach a town wall with
pencils and paper.</p>
<p>M. de ____ is one of the only &#383;ix officers of his regiment
who have not emigrated. With an indignation heated by the works of
modern philo&#383;ophers into an enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic love of
republican governments, and irritated by the contempt and
oppo&#383;ition he has met with from tho&#383;e of this own
cla&#383;s who entertain different principles, he is now become
almo&#383;t a fanatic. What at fir&#383;t was only a political
opinion is now a religious tenet; and the moderate &#383;ectary has
acquired the ob&#383;tinacy of a martyr, and, perhaps, the
&#383;pirit of per&#383;ecution. At the beginning of the
revolution, the nece&#383;&#383;ity of deciding, a youthful ardour
for liberty, and the de&#383;ire of pre&#383;erving his fortune,
probably determined him to become a patriot; and pride and
re&#383;entment have given &#383;tability to notions which might
otherwi&#383;e have fluctuated with circum&#383;tances, or yielded
to time. This is but too general the ca&#383;e: the friends of
rational reform, and the &#383;upporters of the ancient monarchy,
have too deeply offended each other for pardon or confidence; and
the country perhaps will be &#383;acrificed by the mutual
de&#383;ertions of tho&#383;e mo&#383;t concerned in its
pre&#383;ervation. Actuated only by &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s and
revenge, each party willingly con&#383;ent&#383; to the ruin of its
opponents. The Clergy, already divided among them&#383;elves, are
abandoned by the Noble&#383;&#383;e&mdash;the Noble&#383;&#383;e
are per&#383;ecuted by the commercial intere&#383;t&mdash;and, in
&#383;hort, the only union is among&#383;t the Jacobins; that is,
among&#383;t a few weak per&#383;ons who are deceived, and a
banditti who betray and profit by their "patrioti&#383;m."</p>
<p>I was led to the&#383;e reflections by my conver&#383;ation with
Mr. de L____ and his companions. I believe they do not approve of
the pre&#383;ent extremes, yet they expre&#383;&#383;ed
them&#383;elves with the utmo&#383;t virulence again&#383;t the
ari&#383;tocrates, and would hear neither of reconcilement nor
palliation. On the other hand, the&#383;e di&#383;po&#383;itions
were not altogether unprovoked&mdash;the young men had been
per&#383;ecuted by their relations, and bani&#383;hed the
&#383;ociety of their acquaintance; and their political opinions
had acted a&#383; an univer&#383;al pro&#383;cription. There were
even &#383;ome again&#383;t whom the door&#383; of the parental
habitation were &#383;hut.&mdash;The&#383;e party violences are
terrible; and I was happy to perceive that the reciprocal claims of
duty and affection were not dimini&#383;hed by them, either in M.
de ____, or hi&#383; &#383;on. He, however, at fir&#383;t
refu&#383;ed to come to A____, becau&#383;e he &#383;u&#383;pected
the patrioti&#383;m of our &#383;ociety. I pleaded, as an
inducement, the beauty of Mad. G____, but he told me &#383;he was
an ari&#383;tocrate. It wa&#383; at length, however, determined,
that he &#383;hould dine with us la&#383;t Sunday, and that all
vi&#383;itors &#383;hould be excluded. He was prevented coming by
being ordered out with a party the day we left him; and he has
written to us in high &#383;pirits, to &#383;ay, that, be&#383;ides
fulfilling his object, he had returned with fifty
pri&#383;oners.</p>
<p>We had a very narrow e&#383;cape in coming home&mdash;the Hulans
were at the village of ____, an hour after we pa&#383;&#383;ed
through it, and treated the poor inhabitants, as they u&#383;ually
do, with great inhumanity.&mdash;Nothing ha&#383; alienated the
minds of the people &#383;o much as the cruelties of the&#383;e
troop&#383;&mdash;they plunder and ill treat all they encounter;
and their avarice is even le&#383;s in&#383;atiable than their
barbarity. How hard is it, that the ambition of the Chiefs, and the
wickedne&#383;s of faction, &#383;hould thus fall upon the innocent
cottager, who perhaps is equally a &#383;tranger to the names of
the one, and the principles of the other!</p>
<p>The public papers will now inform you, that the French are at
liberty to obtain a divorce on almo&#383;t any pretext, or even on
no pretext at all, except what many may think a very good
one&mdash;mutual agreement. A lady of our acquaintance here is
become a republican in con&#383;equence of the decree, and probably
will very &#383;oon avail her&#383;elf of it; but thi&#383;
conduct, I conceive, will not be very general.</p>
<p>Much has been &#383;aid of the gallantry of the French ladies,
and not entirely without rea&#383;on; yet, though &#383;ometimes
incon&#383;tant wives, they are, for the mo&#383;t part, faithful
friend&#383;&mdash;they &#383;acrifice the hu&#383;band without
for&#383;aking him, and their common intere&#383;t is always
promoted with as much zeal as the mo&#383;t inviolable attachment
could in&#383;pire. Mad. de C____, whom we often meet in company,
is the wife of an emigrant, and i&#383; &#383;aid not to be
ab&#383;olutely di&#383;con&#383;olate at his ab&#383;ence; yet
&#383;he i&#383; indefatigable in her efforts to &#383;upply him
with money: &#383;he even ri&#383;ks her &#383;afety by her
&#383;olicitude, and has ju&#383;t now prevailed on her favourite
admirer to ha&#383;ten his departure for the frontiers, in order to
convey a &#383;um &#383;he has with much difficulty been
rai&#383;ing. Such in&#383;tances are, I believe, not very rare;
and as a Frenchman u&#383;ually prefers his intere&#383;t to every
thing el&#383;e, and is not quite &#383;o unaccommodating as an
Engli&#383;hman, an amicable arrangement takes place, and one
&#383;eldom hears of a &#383;eparation.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Arras, with all their patrioti&#383;m, are
extremely aver&#383;e from the a&#383;&#383;ignats; and it is with
great reluctance that they con&#383;ent to receive them at
two-thirds of their nominal value. This di&#383;credit of the paper
money has been now two months at a &#383;tand, and its ri&#383;e or
fall will be determined by the &#383;ucce&#383;s of the
campaign.&mdash;I bid you adieu for the la&#383;t time from hence.
We have already exceeded the propo&#383;ed length of our
vi&#383;it, and &#383;hall &#383;et out for St. Omer
to-morrow.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>St. Omer, September, 1792.</h2>
<p>I am confined to my room by a &#383;light
indi&#383;po&#383;ition, and, in&#383;tead of accompanying my
friends, have taken up my pen to inform you that we are thus far
&#383;afe on our journey.&mdash;Do not, becau&#383;e you are
&#383;urrounded by a protecting element, &#383;mile at the idea of
travelling forty or fifty mile&#383; in &#383;afety. The light
troops of the Au&#383;trian army penetrate &#383;o far, that none
of the roads on the frontier are entirely free from danger. My
female companions were alarmed the whole day&mdash;the young for
their baggage, and the old for them&#383;elves.</p>
<p>The country between this and Arras has the appearance of a
garden cultivated for the common u&#383;e of its inhabitants, and
has all the fertility and beauty of which a flat &#383;urface is
&#383;u&#383;ceptible. Bethune and Aire I &#383;hould
&#383;uppo&#383;e &#383;trongly fortified. I did not fail, in
pa&#383;&#383;ing through the former, to recollect with veneration
the faithful mini&#383;ter of Henry the Fourth. The
mi&#383;fortunes of the de&#383;cendant of Henry, whom Sully*
loved, and the &#383;tate of the kingdom he &#383;o much
cheri&#383;hed, made a &#383;tronger impre&#383;&#383;ion on me
than u&#383;ual, and I mingled with the tribute of re&#383;pect a
&#383;entiment of indignation.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Maximilien de Bethune, Duc de Sully.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>What perver&#383;e and malignant influence can have excited the
people either to incur or to &#383;uffer their pre&#383;ent
&#383;ituation? Were we not well acquainted with the arts of
factions, the activity of bad men, and the effect of their union, I
&#383;hould be almo&#383;t tempted to believe this change in the
French &#383;upernatural. Le&#383;s than three years ago, the name
of Henri Quatre was not uttered without enthu&#383;ia&#383;m. The
piece that tran&#383;mitted the &#383;lighte&#383;t anecdotes of
his life was certain of &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;&mdash;the air that
celebrated him was li&#383;tened to with delight&mdash;and the
decorations of beauty, when a&#383;&#383;ociated with the idea of
this gallant Monarch, became more irre&#383;i&#383;tible.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* At this time it was the prevailing fa&#383;hion to
call any new inventions of female dre&#383;s after his name, and to
decorate the ornamental parts of furniture with his
re&#383;emblance.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet Henry the Fourth is now a tyrant&mdash;his pictures and
&#383;tatues are de&#383;troyed, and his memory is
execrated!&mdash;Tho&#383;e who have reduced the French to this
are, doubtle&#383;s, ba&#383;e and de&#383;igning intriguers; yet I
cannot acquit the people, who are thus wrought on, of
unfeelingne&#383;s and levity.&mdash;England has had its
revolutions; but the names of Henry the Fifth and Elizabeth were
&#383;till revered: and the regal monuments, which &#383;till
exi&#383;t, after all the vici&#383;&#383;itudes of our political
principles, atte&#383;t the mildne&#383;s of the Engli&#383;h
republicans.</p>
<p>The la&#383;t days of our &#383;tay at Arras were embittered by
the di&#383;tre&#383;s of our neighbour and acquaintance, Madame de
B____. She has lo&#383;t two &#383;ons under circum&#383;tances
&#383;o affecting, that I think you will be intere&#383;ted in the
relation.&mdash;The two young men were in the army, and quartered
at Perpignan, at a time when &#383;ome effort of counter-revolution
was &#383;aid to be intended. One of them was arre&#383;ted as
being concerned, and the other &#383;urrendered him&#383;elf
pri&#383;oner to accompany his brother.&mdash;When the High Court
at Orleans was in&#383;tituted for trying
&#383;tate-pri&#383;oners, tho&#383;e of Perpignan were ordered to
be conducted there, and the two B____'s, chained together, were
taken with the re&#383;t. On their arrival at Orleans, their gaoler
had mi&#383;laid the key that unlocked their fetters, and, not
finding it immediately, the young men produced one, which
an&#383;wered the purpo&#383;e, and relea&#383;ed them&#383;elves.
The gaoler looked at them with &#383;urprize, and a&#383;ked why,
with &#383;uch a means in their power, they had not e&#383;caped in
the night, or on the road. They replied, becau&#383;e they were not
culpable, and had no rea&#383;on for avoiding a trial that would
manife&#383;t their innocence. Their heroi&#383;m was fatal. They
were brought, by a decree of the Convention, from Orleans to
Ver&#383;ailles, (on their way to Paris,) where they were met by
the mob, and ma&#383;&#383;acred.</p>
<p>Their unfortunate mother is yet ignorant of their fate; but we
left her in a &#383;tate little preferable to that which will be
the effect of certainty. She &#383;aw the decree for
tran&#383;porting the pri&#383;oners from Orleans, and all accounts
of the re&#383;ult have been carefully concealed from her; yet her
anxious and enquiring looks at all who approach her, indicate but
too well her &#383;u&#383;picion of the truth.&mdash;Mons. de
____'&#383; &#383;ituation is inde&#383;cribable. Informed of the
death of his &#383;ons, he is yet obliged to conceal his
&#383;ufferings, and wear an appearance of tranquillity in the
pre&#383;ence of his wife. Sometimes he e&#383;capes, when unable
to contain his emotions any longer, and remains at M. de ____'s
till he recovers him&#383;elf. He takes no notice of the
&#383;ubject of his grief, and we re&#383;pect it too much to
attempt to con&#383;ole him. The la&#383;t time I a&#383;ked him
after Madame de ____, he told me her &#383;pirits were
&#383;omething better, and, added he, in a voice almo&#383;t
&#383;uffocated, "She is amu&#383;ing her&#383;elf with working
neckcloths for her &#383;on&#383;!"&mdash;When you reflect that the
ma&#383;&#383;acres at Paris took place on the &#383;econd and
third of September, and that the decree was pa&#383;&#383;ed to
bring the pri&#383;oners from Orleans (where they were in
&#383;afety) on the tenth, I can &#383;ay nothing that will add to
the horror of this tran&#383;action, or to your dete&#383;tation of
its cau&#383;e. Sixty-two, mo&#383;tly people of high rank, fell
victims to this barbarous policy: they were brought in a fort of
covered waggons, and were murdered in heaps without being taken
out.*</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>* Perhaps the reader will be plea&#383;ed at a
di&#383;covery, which it would have been un&#383;afe to mention
when made, or in the cour&#383;e of thi&#383; corre&#383;pondence.
The two young men here alluded to arrived at Ver&#383;ailles,
chained together, with their fellow-pri&#383;oners. Surprize,
perhaps admiration, had diverted the gaoler's attention from
demanding the key that opened their padlock, and it was &#383;till
in their po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion. On entering
Ver&#383;ailles, and ob&#383;erving the crowd preparing to attack
them, they dive&#383;ted them&#383;elves of their fetters, and of
every other incumbrance. In a few moments their carriages were
&#383;urrounded, their companions at one end were already murdered,
and them&#383;elves &#383;lightly wounded; but the confu&#383;ion
increa&#383;ing, they darted amid&#383;t the croud, and were in a
moment undi&#383;tingui&#383;hable. They were afterwards taken
under the protection of an humane magi&#383;trate, who concealed
them for &#383;ome time, and they are now in perfect &#383;ecurity.
They were the only two of the whole number that
e&#383;caped.</blockquote>

<h2>September, 1792.</h2>
<p>We pa&#383;&#383;ed a country &#383;o barren and
unintere&#383;ting ye&#383;terday, that even a
profe&#383;&#383;ional traveller could not have made a &#383;ingle
page of it. It was, in every thing, a perfect contra&#383;t to the
rich plains of Artoi&#383;&mdash; unfertile, neglected vallies and
hills, mi&#383;erable farms, &#383;till more mi&#383;erable
cottages, and &#383;carcely any appearance of population. The only
place where we could refre&#383;h the hor&#383;es was a &#383;mall
hou&#383;e, over the door of which was the pompous de&#383;ignation
of Hotel d'Angleterre. I know not if this be intended as a ridicule
on our country, or as an attraction to our countrymen, but I,
however, found &#383;omething be&#383;ides the appellation which
reminded me of England, and which one does not often find in
hou&#383;e&#383; of a better out&#383;ide; for though the rooms
were &#383;mall, and only two in number, they were very clean, and
the ho&#383;te&#383;s was neat and civil. The Hotel d'Angleterre,
indeed, was not luxuriou&#383;ly &#383;upplied, and the whole of
our repa&#383;t was eggs and tea, which we had brought with
us.&mdash;In the next room to that we occupied were two
pri&#383;oners chained, whom the officers were conveying to Arras,
for the purpo&#383;e of better &#383;ecurity. The &#383;ecret
hi&#383;tory of this bu&#383;ine&#383;s is worth relating, as it
marks the character of the moment, and the a&#383;cendancy which
the Jacobins are daily acquiring.</p>
<p>The&#383;e men were apprehended as &#383;mugglers, under
circum&#383;tances of peculiar atrocity, and committed to the gaol
at ____. A few days after, a young girl, of bad character, who has
much influence at the club, made a motion, that the people, in a
body, &#383;hould demand the relea&#383;e of the pri&#383;oners.
The motion was carried, and the Hotel de Ville a&#383;&#383;ailed
by a formidable troop of &#383;ailors, fi&#383;h-women,
&amp;c.&mdash;The municipality refu&#383;ed to comply, the Garde
Nationale was called out, and, on the mob per&#383;i&#383;ting,
fired over their heads, wounded a few, and the re&#383;t
di&#383;per&#383;ed of them&#383;elves.&mdash;Now you mu&#383;t
under&#383;tand, the latent motive of all this wa&#383; two
thou&#383;and livres promi&#383;ed to one of the Jacobin leaders,
if he &#383;ucceeded in procuring the men their liberty.&mdash;I do
not advance thi&#383; merely on conjecture. The fact is well known
to the municipality; and the decent part of it would willingly have
expelled this man, who is one of their members, but that they found
them&#383;elves too weak to engage in a &#383;erious quarrel with
the Jacobins.&mdash;One cannot reflect, without apprehen&#383;ion,
that any &#383;ociety &#383;hould exi&#383;t which can oppo&#383;e
the execution of the laws with impunity, or that a people, who are
little &#383;en&#383;ible of realities, &#383;hould be thus
abu&#383;ed by names. They &#383;uffer, with unfeeling patience, a
thou&#383;and enormitie&#383;&mdash;yet blindly ri&#383;k their
liberties and lives to promote the de&#383;igns of an adventurer,
becau&#383;e he harangues at a club, and calls him&#383;elf a
patriot.&mdash;I have ju&#383;t received advice that my friends
have left Lau&#383;anne, and are on their way to Paris. Our
fir&#383;t plan of pa&#383;&#383;ing the winter there will be
imprudent, if not impracticable, and we have concluded to take a
hou&#383;e for the winter &#383;ix months at Amiens, Chantilly, or
&#383;ome place which has the reputation of being quiet. I have
already ordered enquiries to be made, and &#383;hall &#383;et out
with Mrs. ____ in a day or two for Amiens. I may, perhaps, not
write till our return; but &#383;hall not cea&#383;e to be, with
great truth.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Amiens, 1792.</h2>
<p>The departement de la Somme has the reputation of being a little
ari&#383;tocratic. I know not how far this be merited, but the
people are certainly not enthu&#383;ia&#383;ts. The villages we
pa&#383;&#383;ed on our road hither were very different from
tho&#383;e on the frontier&#383;&mdash;we were hailed by no popular
&#383;ounds, no cries of Vive la nation! except from here and there
&#383;ome ragged boy in a red cap, who, from habit,
a&#383;&#383;ociated this &#383;alutation with the appearance of a
carriage. In every place where there are half a dozen hou&#383;es
is planted an unthriving tree of liberty, which &#383;eems to
wither under the baneful influence of the <i>bonnet rouge</i>. [The
red cap.] This Jacobin attribute is made of materials to
re&#383;i&#383;t the weather, and may la&#383;t &#383;ome time; but
the trees of liberty, being planted un&#383;ea&#383;onably, are
already dead. I hope this will not prove emblematic, and that the
power of the Jacobins may not outlive the freedom of the
people.</p>
<p>The Convention begin their labours under di&#383;agreeable
au&#383;pices. A general terror &#383;eems to have &#383;eized on
the Pari&#383;ians, the roads are covered with carriages, and the
inns filled with travellers. A new regulation has ju&#383;t taken
place, apparently intended to check thi&#383; re&#383;tle&#383;s
&#383;pirit. At Abbeville, though we arrived late and were
fatigued, we were taken to the municipality, our
pa&#383;&#383;ports collated with our per&#383;ons, and at the inn
we were obliged to in&#383;ert in a book our names, the place of
our birth, from whence we came, and where we were going. This, you
will &#383;ay, has more the features of a mature Inqui&#383;ition,
than a new-born Republic; but the French have different notions of
liberty from yours, and take the&#383;e things very
quietly.&mdash;At Flixecourt we eat out of pewter &#383;poons, and
the people told us, with much inquietude, that they had &#383;old
their plate, in expectation of a decree of the Convention to take
it from them. This decree, however, has not pa&#383;&#383;ed, but
the alarm is univer&#383;al, and does not imply any great
confidence in the new government.</p>
<p>I have had much difficulty in executing my commi&#383;&#383;ion,
and have at la&#383;t fixed upon a hou&#383;e, of which I fear my
friends will not approve; but the panic which depopulates Paris,
the bombardment of Li&#383;le, and the tranquillity which has
hitherto prevailed here, has filled the town, and rendered every
kind of habitation &#383;carce, and extravagantly dear: for you
mu&#383;t remark, that though the Amienois are all
ari&#383;tocrates, yet when an intimidated &#383;ufferer of the
&#383;ame party flies from Paris, and &#383;eeks an a&#383;ylum
among&#383;t them, they calculate with much exactitude what they
&#383;uppo&#383;e nece&#383;&#383;ity may compel him to give, and
will not take a livre le&#383;s.&mdash;The rent of hou&#383;es and
lodgings, like the national funds, ri&#383;e&#383; and falls with
the public di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es, and, like them, is an object
of &#383;peculation: &#383;everal per&#383;ons to whom we were
addre&#383;&#383;ed were extremely indifferent about letting their
hou&#383;es, alledging as a rea&#383;on, that if the di&#383;orders
of Paris &#383;hould increa&#383;e, they had no doubt of letting
them to much greater advantage.</p>
<p>We were at the theatre la&#383;t night&mdash;it was opened for
the fir&#383;t time &#383;ince France has been declared a republic,
and the Jacobins vociferated loudly to have the fleur de lys, ad
other regal emblems, effaced. Obedience wa&#383; no &#383;ooner
promi&#383;ed to this command, than it was &#383;ucceeded by
another not quite &#383;o ea&#383;ily complied with&mdash;they
in&#383;i&#383;ted on having the Mar&#383;elloi&#383; Hymn
&#383;ung. In vain did the manager, with a ludicrous &#383;ort of
terror, declare, that there were none of his company who had any
voice, or who knew either the words of the mu&#383;ic of the hymn
in que&#383;tion. <i>"C'e&#383;t egal, il faut chanter,"</i> ["No
matter for that, they mu&#383;t &#383;ing."] re&#383;ounded from
all the patriots in the hou&#383;e. At la&#383;t, finding the thing
impo&#383;&#383;ible, they agreed to a compromi&#383;e; and one of
the actors promi&#383;ed to &#383;ing it on the morrow, as well as
the trifling impediment of having no voice would permit
him.&mdash;You think your galleries de&#383;potic when they call
for an epilogue that is forgotten, and the actre&#383;s who
&#383;hould &#383;peak it i&#383; undre&#383;t; or when they
in&#383;i&#383;t upon enlivening the la&#383;t acts of Jane Shore
with Roa&#383;t Beef! What would you think if they would not
di&#383;pen&#383;e with a hornpipe on the tight-rope by Mrs. Webb?
Yet, bating the danger, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, the audience of
Amiens was equally unrea&#383;onable. But liberty at pre&#383;ent
&#383;eems to be in an undefined &#383;tate; and until our rulers
&#383;hall have determined what it is, the matter will continue to
be &#383;ettled as it is now&mdash;by each man u&#383;urping as
large a portion of tyranny as hi&#383; &#383;ituation will admit
of. He who &#383;ubmits without repining to hi&#383; di&#383;trict,
to his municipality, or even to the club, domineers at the theatre,
or exerci&#383;es in the &#383;treet a manual cen&#383;ure on
ari&#383;tocratic apparel.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*It was common at this time to in&#383;ult women in the
&#383;treets if dre&#383;&#383;ed too well, or in colours the
people cho&#383;e to call ari&#383;tocratic. I was my&#383;elf
nearly thrown down for having on a &#383;traw bonnet with green
ribbons.</blockquote>

<p>Our embarra&#383;&#383;ment for &#383;mall change is renewed:
many of the communes who had i&#383;&#383;ued bills of five, ten,
and fifteen &#383;ols, repayable in a&#383;&#383;ignats, are become
bankrupts, which circum&#383;tance has thrown &#383;uch a
di&#383;credit on all this kind of nominal money, that the bills of
one town will not pa&#383;&#383; at another. The original creation
of the&#383;e bills was &#383;o limited, that no town had half the
number requi&#383;ite for the circulation of it&#383;
neighbourhood; and this decrea&#383;e, with the di&#383;tru&#383;t
that ari&#383;es from the occa&#383;ion of it, greatly adds to the
general inconvenience.</p>
<p>The retreat of the Pru&#383;&#383;ian army excites more
&#383;urprize than intere&#383;t, and the people talk of it with as
much indifference as they would of an event that had happened
beyond the Ganges. The &#383;iege of Li&#383;le takes off all
attention from the relief of Thionville&mdash;not on account of
it&#383; importance, but on account of its novelty.&mdash;I remain,

<h2>Abbeville, September, 1792.</h2>
<p>We left Amiens early ye&#383;terday morning, but were &#383;o
much delayed by the number of volunteers on the road, that it was
late before we reached Abbeville. I was at fir&#383;t &#383;omewhat
alarmed at finding our&#383;elve&#383; &#383;urrounded by &#383;o
formidable a cortege; they however only exacted a declaration of
our political principles, and we purcha&#383;ed our &#383;afety by
a few &#383;miles, and exclamations of vive la nation! There were
&#383;ome hundred&#383; of the&#383;e recruits much under twenty;
but the poor fellows, exhilarated by their new uniform and large
pay, were going gaily to decide their fate by that hazard which
puts youth and age on a level, and &#383;catters with
indi&#383;criminating hand the cypre&#383;s and the laurel.</p>
<p>At Abbeville all the former precautions were renewed&mdash;we
underwent another &#383;olemn identification of our per&#383;ons at
the Hotel de Ville, and an ab&#383;tract of our hi&#383;tory was
again enregi&#383;tered at the inn. One would really
&#383;uppo&#383;e that the town was under apprehen&#383;ions of a
&#383;iege, or, at lea&#383;t, of the plague. My "paper face" was
examined as &#383;u&#383;piciou&#383;ly a&#383; though I had had
the appearance of a trave&#383;tied Achilles; and M____'s, which
has as little expre&#383;&#383;ion as a Chine&#383;e painting, was
elaborately &#383;crutinized by a Dogberry in &#383;pectacles, who,
perhaps, fancied &#383;he had the features of a female Machiavel.
All this was done with an air of importance &#383;ufficiently
ludicrous, when contra&#383;ted with the object; but we met with no
incivility, and had nothing to complain of but a little additional
fatigue, and the delay of our dinner.</p>
<p>We &#383;topped to change hor&#383;es at Bernay, and I &#383;oon
perceived our landlady was a very ardent patriot. In a room, to
which we waded at great ri&#383;k of our clothes, was a
repre&#383;entation of the &#383;iege of the Ba&#383;tille, and
prints of half a dozen American Generals, headed by Mr. Thomas
Paine. On de&#383;cending, we found out ho&#383;te&#383;s
exhibiting a &#383;till more forcible picture of curio&#383;ity
than Shak&#383;peare's black&#383;mith. The half-demoli&#383;hed
repa&#383;t was cooling on the table, whil&#383;t our
po&#383;tilion retailed the Gazette, and the pigs and ducks were
amicably grazing together on whatever the kitchen produced. The
affairs of the Pru&#383;&#383;ians and Au&#383;trians were
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed with entire unanimity, but when the&#383;e
politicians, as is often the ca&#383;e, came to adju&#383;t their
own particular account, the conference was much le&#383;&#383;
harmonious. The po&#383;tilion offered a ten &#383;ols billet,
which the landlady refu&#383;ed: one per&#383;i&#383;ted in its
validity, the other in rejecting it&mdash;till, at la&#383;t, the
patrioti&#383;m of neither could endure this proof, and peace
wa&#383; concluded by a joint execration of tho&#383;e who invented
this fichu papier&mdash; "Sorry paper."</p>
<p>At ____ we met our friend, Mad. de ____, with part of her family
and an immen&#383;e quantity of baggage. I was both &#383;urprized
and alarmed at &#383;uch an apparition, and found, on enquiry, that
they thought them&#383;elves un&#383;afe at Arras, and were going
to re&#383;ide near M. de ____'s e&#383;tate, where they were
better known. I really began to doubt the prudence of our
e&#383;tabli&#383;hing our&#383;elves here for the winter. Every
one who has it in his power endeavours to emigrate, even tho&#383;e
who till now have been zealou&#383; &#383;upporters of the
revolution.&mdash;Di&#383;tru&#383;t and apprehen&#383;ion
&#383;eem to have taken po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of every
mind. Tho&#383;e who are in towns fly to the country, while the
inhabitant of the i&#383;olated chateau takes refuge in the
neighbouring town. Flocks of both ari&#383;tocrates and patriots
are trembling and fluttering at the foreboding &#383;torm, yet
prefer to abide it&#383; fury, rather than &#383;eek &#383;helter
and defence together. I, however, flatter my&#383;elf, that the new
government will not ju&#383;tify this fear; and as I am certain my
friends will not return to England at this &#383;ea&#383;on, I
&#383;hall not endeavour to intimidate or di&#383;courage them from
their pre&#383;ent arrangement. We &#383;hall, at lea&#383;t, be
enabled to form &#383;ome idea of a republican con&#383;titution,
and I do not, on reflection, conceive that any po&#383;&#383;ible
harm can happen to us.</p>

<h2>October, 1792.</h2>
<p>I &#383;hall not date from this place again, intending to quit
it as &#383;oon a&#383; po&#383;&#383;ible. It is di&#383;turbed by
the crouds from the camps, which are broken up, and the
&#383;oldiers are extremely brutal and in&#383;olent. So much are
the people already familiarized with the unnatural depravity of
manners that begins to prevail, that the wife of the Colonel of a
battalion now here walks the &#383;treets in a red cap, with
pi&#383;tols at her girdle, boa&#383;ting of the numbers &#383;he
has de&#383;troyed at the ma&#383;&#383;acres in Augu&#383;t and
September.</p>
<p>The Convention talk of the King's trial as a decided
mea&#383;ure; yet no one &#383;eems to admit even the
po&#383;&#383;ibility that &#383;uch an act can be ever intended. A
few believe him culpable, many think him mi&#383;led, and many
acquit him totally: but all agree, that any violation of his
per&#383;on would be an atrocity di&#383;graceful to the nation at
large.&mdash;The fate of Prince&#383; is often di&#383;a&#383;trous
in proportion to their virtues. The vanity,
&#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s, and bigotry of Louis the Fourteenth
were flattered while he lived, and procured him the appellation of
Great after his death. The greate&#383;t military talents that
France has given birth to &#383;eemed created to earn laurels, not
for them&#383;elves, but for the brow of that vain-glorious
Monarch. Indu&#383;try and Science toiled but for hi&#383;
gratification, and Genius, forgetting its dignity, willingly
received from his award the &#383;ame it has &#383;ince
be&#383;towed.</p>
<p>Louis the Fifteenth, who corrupted the people by his example,
and ruined them by his expence, knew no diminution of the loyalty,
whatever he might of the affection, of his people, and ended his
days in the practice of the &#383;ame vices, and &#383;urrounded by
the &#383;ame luxury, in which he had pa&#383;&#383;ed them.</p>
<p>Louis the Sixteenth, to whom &#383;carcely his enemies
a&#383;cribe any vices, for its outrages again&#383;t whom faction
finds no excu&#383;e but in the facility of his
nature&mdash;who&#383;e devotion is at once exemplary and
tolerant&mdash;who, in an age of licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s, is
remarkable for the &#383;implicity of his manner&#383;&mdash;
who&#383;e amu&#383;ements were liberal or
inoffen&#383;ive&mdash;and who&#383;e conce&#383;&#383;ions to his
people form a &#383;triking contra&#383;t with the exactions of
hi&#383; predece&#383;&#383;ors.&mdash;Yes, the Monarch I have been
de&#383;cribing, and, I think, not partially, has been overwhelmed
with &#383;orrow and indignitie&#383;&mdash;his per&#383;on has
been degraded, that he might be de&#383;poiled of his crown, and
perhap&#383; the &#383;acrifice of his crown may be followed by
that of his life. When we thus &#383;ee the puni&#383;hment of
guilt accumulated on the head of him who ha&#383; not participated
in it, and vice triumph in the &#383;ecurity that &#383;hould
&#383;eem the lot of innocence, we can only adduce new motives to
fortify our&#383;elve&#383; in this great truth of our
religion&mdash;that the cha&#383;ti&#383;ement of the one, and
reward of the other, mu&#383;t be looked for beyond the inflictions
or enjoyments of our pre&#383;ent exi&#383;tence.</p>
<p>I do not often moralize on paper, but there are moments when one
derive&#383; one's be&#383;t con&#383;olation from &#383;o
moralizing; and this ea&#383;y and &#383;imple ju&#383;tification
of Providence, which refers all that appears incon&#383;i&#383;tent
here to the retribution of a future &#383;tate, is pointed out
le&#383;s as the duty than the happine&#383;s of mankind. This
&#383;ingle argument of religion &#383;olves every difficulty, and
leaves the mind in fortitude and peace; whil&#383;t the pride of
&#383;ceptical philo&#383;ophy traces whole volumes, only to
e&#383;tabli&#383;h the doubts, and nouri&#383;h the de&#383;pair,
of its di&#383;ciples.</p>
<p>Adieu. I cannot conclude better than with the&#383;e
reflections, at a time when di&#383;belief is &#383;omething too
fa&#383;hionable even among&#383;t our countrymen.&mdash;Yours,

<h2>Amiens, October, 1792.</h2>
<p>I arrived here the day on which a ball was given to celebrate
the return of the volunteers who had gone to the
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of Li&#383;le.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*The bombardment of Li&#383;le commenced on the
twenty-ninth of September, at three o'clock in the afternoon, and
continued, almo&#383;t without interruption, until the &#383;ixth
of October. Many of the public buildings, and whole quarters of the
town, were &#383;o much damaged or de&#383;troyed, that the
&#383;ituation of the &#383;treets were &#383;carcely
di&#383;tingui&#383;hable. The hou&#383;es which the fire obliged
their inhabitants to abandon, were pillaged by barbarians, more
mercile&#383;&#383; than the Au&#383;trians them&#383;elves. Yet,
amid&#383;t the&#383;e accumulated horrors, the Lillois not only
pre&#383;erved their courage, but their pre&#383;ence of mind: the
rich incited and encouraged the poor; tho&#383;e who were unable to
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t with their labour, rewarded with their
wealth: the men were employed in endeavouring to extingui&#383;h
the fire of the buildings, or in pre&#383;erving their effects;
while women and children &#383;natched the opportunity of
extingui&#383;hing the fuzes of the bombs as &#383;oon as they
fell, at which they became very daring and dexterous. During the
whole of this dreadful period, not one murmur, not one
propo&#383;ition to &#383;urrender, was heard from any party.
&mdash;The Convention decreed, amid&#383;t the wilde&#383;t
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m of applau&#383;e, that Li&#383;le had
de&#383;erved well of the country. &mdash;Forty-two thou&#383;and
five hundred balls were fired, and the damage&#383; were
e&#383;timated at forty millions of livres.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The French, indeed, never refu&#383;e to rejoice when they are
ordered; but a&#383; the&#383;e fe&#383;tivities are not
&#383;pontaneous effu&#383;ions, but official ordinances, and
regulated with the &#383;ame method as a tax or recruitment, they
are of cour&#383;e languid and unintere&#383;ting. The whole of
their hilarity &#383;eems to con&#383;i&#383;t in the movement of
the dance, in which they are by not mean&#383; animated; and I have
&#383;een, even among the common people, a cotillion performed as
gravely and as mechanically as the ceremonies of a Chine&#383;e
court.&mdash;I have always thought, with Sterne, that we were
mi&#383;taken in &#383;uppo&#383;ing the French a gay nation. It is
true, they laugh much, have great ge&#383;ticulation, and are
extravagantly fond of dancing: but the laugh is the effect of
habit, and not of a ri&#383;ible &#383;en&#383;ation; the
ge&#383;ture i&#383; not the agitation of the mind operating upon
the body, but con&#383;titutional volatility; and their love of
dancing is merely the effect of a happy climate, (which, though
mild, does not enervate,) and that love of action which
u&#383;ually accompanies mental vacancy, when it is not
counteracted by heat, or other phy&#383;ical cau&#383;es.</p>
<p>I know &#383;uch an opinion, if publicly avowed, would be
combated as fal&#383;e and &#383;ingular; yet I appeal to
tho&#383;e who have at all &#383;tudied the French character, not
as travellers, but by a re&#383;idence among&#383;t them, for the
&#383;upport of my opinion. Every one who under&#383;tands the
language, and ha&#383; mixed much in &#383;ociety, mu&#383;t have
made the &#383;ame ob&#383;ervations.&mdash;See two Frenchmen at a
di&#383;tance, and the vehemence of their action, and the
expre&#383;&#383;ion of their features, &#383;hall make you
conclude they are di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing &#383;ome &#383;ubject,
which not only intere&#383;ts, but delights them. Enquire, and you
will find they were talking of the weather, or the price of a
wai&#383;tcoat!&mdash;In England you would be tempted to call in a
peace-officer at the loud tone and menacing attitudes with which
two people here very amicably adju&#383;t a bargain for five
livres.&mdash;In &#383;hort, we mi&#383;take that for a mental
quality which, in fact, is but a corporeal one; and, though the
French may have many good and agreeable points of character, I do
not include gaiety among the number.</p>
<p>I doubt very much of my friends will approve of their
habitation. I confe&#383;s I am by no means &#383;ati&#383;fied
with it my&#383;elf; and, with regard to pecuniary
con&#383;ideration, my engagement is not an advantageous one.
&mdash;Madame Dorval, of whom I have taken the hou&#383;e, is a
character very common in France, and over which I was little
calculated to have the a&#383;cendant. Officiou&#383;ly polite in
her manners, and inflexibly attentive to her intere&#383;t,
&#383;he &#383;eemingly acquie&#383;ces in every thing you
propo&#383;e. You would even fancy &#383;he was &#383;olicitous to
&#383;erve you; yet, after a thou&#383;and gracious
&#383;entiments, and as many implied eulogiums on her liberality
and genero&#383;ity, you find her return, with unrelenting
per&#383;everance, to &#383;ome paltry propo&#383;ition, by which
&#383;he is to gain a few livres; and all this &#383;o civilly,
&#383;o &#383;entimentally, and &#383;o determinedly, that you find
your&#383;elf obliged to yield, and are duped without being
deceived.</p>
<p>The lower cla&#383;s have here, as well as on your &#383;ide of
the water, the cu&#383;tom of attributing to Mini&#383;ters and
Governments &#383;ome connection with, or controul over, the
operations of nature. I remarked to a woman who brings me fruit,
that the grapes were bad and dear this year&mdash;<i>"Ah! mon Dieu,
oui, ils ne murri&#383;&#383;ent pas. Il me &#383;emble que tout va
mal depui&#383; qu'on a invente la nation."</i> ["Ah! Lord, they
don't ripen now.&mdash;For my part, I think nothing has gone well
&#383;ince the nation was fir&#383;t invented."]</p>
<p>I cannot, like the imitators of Sterne, tran&#383;late a chapter
of &#383;entiment from every incident that occurs, or from every
phy&#383;iognomy I encounter; yet, in circum&#383;tances like the
pre&#383;ent, the mind, not u&#383;ually ob&#383;erving, is tempted
to comment.&mdash;I was in a milliner's &#383;hop to-day, and took
notice on my entering, that its mi&#383;tre&#383;s was, whil&#383;t
at her work, learning the <i>Mar&#383;eilloi&#383;</i> Hymn. [A
patriotic air, at this time highly popular.] Before I had concluded
my purcha&#383;e, an officer came in to prepare her for the
reception of four volunteers, whom &#383;he was to lodge the two
en&#383;uing nights. She a&#383;&#383;ented, indeed, very
graciou&#383;ly, (for a French woman never lo&#383;es the command
of her features,) but a moment after, the Mar&#383;eillois, which
lay on the counter, was thrown a&#383;ide in a pet, and I dare
&#383;ay &#383;he will not re&#383;ume her patriotic ta&#383;te,
nor be reconciled to the revolution, until &#383;ome days after the
volunteers &#383;hall have changed their quarters.</p>
<p>This quartering of troops in private hou&#383;es appears to me
the mo&#383;t grievous and impolitic of all taxes; it adds
embarra&#383;&#383;ment to expence, invades dome&#383;tic comfort,
and conveys &#383;uch an idea of military &#383;ubjection, that I
wonder any people ever &#383;ubmits to it, or any government ever
ventures to impo&#383;e it.</p>
<p>I know not if the Engli&#383;h are con&#383;cious of their own
importance at thi&#383; moment, but it is certain they are the
centre of the hopes and fears of all parties, I might &#383;ay of
all Europe. The ari&#383;tocrates wait with anxiety and
&#383;olicitude a declaration of war, whil&#383;t their
opponent&#383; regard &#383;uch an event as pregnant with
di&#383;tre&#383;s, and even as the &#383;ignal of their ruin. The
body of the people of both parties are aver&#383;e from
increa&#383;ing the number of their enemies; but as the Convention
may be directed by other motives than the public wi&#383;h, it is
impo&#383;&#383;ible to form any conclu&#383;ion on the
&#383;ubject. I am, of cour&#383;e, de&#383;irous of peace, and
&#383;hould be &#383;o from &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s, if I were
not from philanthropy, as a ce&#383;&#383;ation of it at this time
would di&#383;concert all our plans, and oblige us to &#383;eek
refuge at ____, which has ju&#383;t all that is nece&#383;&#383;ary
for our happine&#383;s, except what is mo&#383;t
de&#383;irable&mdash;a mild and dry atmo&#383;phere.&mdash; Yours,

when you con&#383;ider our long &#383;eparation.</p>
<p>My intimacy with Mrs. D____ began when I fir&#383;t came to this
country, and at every &#383;ub&#383;equent vi&#383;it to the
continent it has been renewed and increa&#383;ed into that rational
kind of attachment, which your &#383;ex &#383;eldom allow in ours,
though you your&#383;elves do not abound in examples of it. Mrs.
D____ is one of tho&#383;e characters which are oftener loved than
admired&mdash;more agreeable than hand&#383;ome&mdash;good-natured,
humane, and una&#383;&#383;uming&mdash;and with no mental
preten&#383;ions beyond common &#383;en&#383;e tolerably well
cultivated. The &#383;hades of this portraiture are an extreme of
delicacy, bordering on fa&#383;tidiou&#383;ne&#383;&#383;&mdash;a
trifle of hauteur, not in manners, but
di&#383;po&#383;ition&mdash;and, perhaps, a tincture of
affectation. The&#383;e foibles are, however, in a great degree,
con&#383;titutional: &#383;he is more an invalid than my&#383;elf;
and ill health naturally increa&#383;es irritability, and renders
the mind le&#383;s di&#383;po&#383;ed to bear with inconveniencies;
we avoid company at fir&#383;t, through a &#383;en&#383;e of our
infirmities, till this timidity becomes habitual, and &#383;ettles
almo&#383;t into aver&#383;ion.&mdash;The valetudinarian, who is
obliged to fly the world, in time fancies her&#383;elf above it,
and ends by &#383;uppo&#383;ing there is &#383;ome &#383;uperiority
in differing from other people. Mr. D____ is one of the be&#383;t
men exi&#383;ting&mdash;well bred and well informed; yet, without
its appearing to the common ob&#383;erver, he is of a very
&#383;ingular and original turn of mind. He is mo&#383;t
exceedingly nervous, and this effect of his phy&#383;ical
con&#383;truction has rendered him &#383;o &#383;u&#383;ceptible,
that he is continually agitated and hurt by circum&#383;tance&#383;
which others pa&#383;s by unnoticed. In other re&#383;pects he is a
great lover of exerci&#383;e, fond of dome&#383;tic life, reads
much, and has an aver&#383;ion from bu&#383;tle of all kind.</p>
<p>The bani&#383;hment of the Prie&#383;ts, which in many
in&#383;tances was attended with circum&#383;tances of peculiar
atrocity, has not yet produced tho&#383;e effect&#383; which were
expected from it, and which the promoters of the mea&#383;ure
employed as a pretext for its adoption. There are indeed now no
ma&#383;&#383;e&#383; &#383;aid but by the Con&#383;titutional
Clergy; but as the people are u&#383;ually a&#383; ingenious in
evading laws as legi&#383;lators are in forming them, many
per&#383;ons, in&#383;tead of attending the churches, which they
think profaned by prie&#383;ts who have taken the oaths, flock to
church-yards, chapels, or other places, once appropriated to
religious wor&#383;hip, but in di&#383;u&#383;e &#383;ince the
revolution, and of cour&#383;e not violated by con&#383;titutional
ma&#383;&#383;es. The cemetery of St. Denis, at Amiens, though
large, is on Sundays and holidays &#383;o crouded, that it is
almo&#383;t difficult to enter it. Here the devotees flock in all
weathers, &#383;ay their ma&#383;s, and return with the double
&#383;ati&#383;faction of having pre&#383;erved their allegiance to
the Pope, and ri&#383;ked per&#383;ecution in a cau&#383;e they
deem meritorious. To &#383;ay truth, it i&#383; not very
&#383;urprizing that numbers &#383;hould be prejudiced again&#383;t
the con&#383;titutional clergy. Many of them are, I doubt not,
liberal and well-meaning men, who have preferred peace and
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to theological warfare, and who might not
think them&#383;elves ju&#383;tified in oppo&#383;ing their opinion
to a national deci&#383;ion: yet are there al&#383;o many of
profligate lives, who were never educated for the
profe&#383;&#383;ion, and whom the circum&#383;tances of the times
have tempted to embrace it as a trade, which offered
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence without labour, and influence without
wealth, and which at once &#383;upplied a veil for
licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s, and the means of practi&#383;ing it. Such
pa&#383;tors, it mu&#383;t be confe&#383;&#383;ed, have little
claim to the confidence or re&#383;pect of the people; and that
there are &#383;uch, I do not a&#383;&#383;ert, but on the
mo&#383;t credible information. I will only cite two in&#383;tances
out of many within my own knowledge.</p>
<p>P____n, bi&#383;hop of St. Omer, was originally a prie&#383;t of
Arras, of viciou&#383; character, and many of his ordinations have
been &#383;uch as might be expected from &#383;uch a
patron.&mdash;A man of Arras, who was only known for hi&#383;
vicious pur&#383;uits, and who had the reputation of having
accelerated the death of his wife by ill treatment, applied to
P____n to marry him a &#383;econd time. The good Bi&#383;hop,
preferring the intere&#383;t of his friend to the &#383;alvation of
his flock, advi&#383;ed him to relinqui&#383;h the project of
taking a wife, and offered to give him a cure. The propo&#383;al
was accepted on the &#383;pot, and this pious a&#383;&#383;ociate
of the Reverend P____n wa&#383; immediately inve&#383;ted with the
direction of the con&#383;ciences, and the care of the morals, of
an exten&#383;ive pari&#383;h.</p>
<p>Acts of this nature, it is to be imagined, were pur&#383;ued by
cen&#383;ure and ridicule; but the latter was not often more
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful than on the following
occa&#383;ion:&mdash;Two young men, who&#383;e per&#383;ons were
unknown to the bi&#383;hop, one day procured an audience, and
reque&#383;ted he would recommend them to &#383;ome employment that
would procure them the means of &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence. This
was ju&#383;t a time when the numerous vacancies that had taken
place were not yet &#383;upplied, and many livings were unfilled
for want of candidates. The Bi&#383;hop, who was unwilling that the
nonjuring prie&#383;t&#383; &#383;hould have the triumph of
&#383;eeing their benefices remain vacant, fell into the
&#383;nare, and propo&#383;ed their taking orders. The young men
expre&#383;&#383;ed their joy at the offer; but, after looking
confu&#383;edly on each other, with &#383;ome difficulty and
diffidence, confe&#383;&#383;ed their lives had been &#383;uch as
to preclude them from the profe&#383;&#383;ion, which, but for
thi&#383; impediment, would have &#383;ati&#383;fied them beyond
their hopes. The Bi&#383;hop very complai&#383;antly endeavoured to
obviate the&#383;&#383;e objections, while they continued to
accu&#383;e them&#383;elves of all the &#383;ins in the decalogue;
but the Prelate at length ob&#383;erving he had ordained many
wor&#383;e, the young men &#383;miled contemptuou&#383;ly, and,
turning on their heels, replied, that if prie&#383;ts were made of
wor&#383;e men than they had de&#383;cribed them&#383;elves to be,
they begged to be excu&#383;ed from a&#383;&#383;ociating with
&#383;uch company.</p>
<p>Dumouriez, Cu&#383;tine, Biron, Dillon, &amp;c. are doing
wonders, in &#383;pite of the &#383;ea&#383;on; but the laurel is
an ever-green, and the&#383;e heroes gather it equally among the
&#383;nows of the Alps, and the fogs of Belgium. If we may credit
the French papers too, what they call the cau&#383;e of liberty is
not le&#383;s &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;fully propagated by the pen
than the &#383;word. England is &#383;aid to be on the eve of a
revolution, and all its inhabitants, except the King and Mr. Pitt,
become Jacobins. If I did not believe "the wi&#383;h wa&#383;
father to the thought," I &#383;hould read the&#383;e
a&#383;&#383;ertions with much inquietude, as I have not yet
di&#383;covered the excellencies of a republican form of government
&#383;ufficiently to make me wi&#383;h it &#383;ub&#383;tituted for
our own.&mdash;It &#383;hould &#383;eem that the Temple of Liberty,
as well as the Temple of Virtue, is placed on an a&#383;cent, and
that as many inflexions and retrogradations occur in endeavouring
to attain it. In the ardour of reaching the&#383;e difficult
acclivities, a fall &#383;ometimes leaves us lower than the
&#383;ituation we fir&#383;t &#383;et out from; or, to &#383;peak
without a figure, &#383;o much power is exerci&#383;ed by our
leaders, and &#383;o much &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion exacted from
the people, that the French are in danger of becoming habituated to
a de&#383;poti&#383;m which almo&#383;t &#383;anctifies the errors
of their ancient monarchy, while they &#383;uppo&#383;e
them&#383;elves in the pur&#383;uit of a degree of freedom more
&#383;ublime and more ab&#383;olute than has been enjoyed by any
other nation.&mdash; Attempts at political as well as moral
perfection, when carried beyond the limits compatible with a
&#383;ocial &#383;tate, or the weakne&#383;s of our natures, are
likely to end in a depravity which moderate governments and
rational ethics would have prevented.</p>
<p>The debates of the Convention are violent and acrimonious.
Robe&#383;pierre has been accu&#383;ed of a&#383;piring to the
Dictator&#383;hip, and his defence was by no means calculated to
exonerate him from the charge. All the chief&#383; reproach each
other with being the authors of the late ma&#383;&#383;acres, and
each &#383;ucceeds better in fixing the imputation on his
neighbour, than in removing it from him&#383;elf. General
reprobation, per&#383;onal invectives, and long &#383;peeches, are
not wanting; but every thing which tends to examination and enquiry
is treated with much more delicacy and compo&#383;ure: &#383;o that
I fear the&#383;e fir&#383;t legi&#383;lators of the republic
mu&#383;t, for the pre&#383;ent, be content with the reputation
they have a&#383;&#383;igned each other, and rank among&#383;t
tho&#383;e who have all the guilt, but want the courage, of
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins.</p>
<p>I &#383;ubjoin an extract from a new&#383;paper, which has
lately appeared.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*Extract from <i>The Courier de l'Egalite,</i>
November, 1792: "There are di&#383;contented people who &#383;till
venture to obtrude their &#383;entiments on the public. One of
them, in a public print, thu&#383; expre&#383;&#383;es
him&#383;elf&mdash; 'I a&#383;&#383;ert, that the new&#383;papers
are &#383;old and devoted to fal&#383;ehood. At this price they
purcha&#383;e the liberty of appearing; and the exclu&#383;ive
privilege they enjoy, as well as the contradictory and lying
a&#383;&#383;ertions they all contain, prove the truth of what I
advance. They are all preachers of liberty, yet never was liberty
&#383;o &#383;hamefully outraged&mdash;of re&#383;pect for
property, and property was at no time &#383;o little held
&#383;acred&mdash;of per&#383;onal &#383;ecurity, yet when were
there committed &#383;o many ma&#383;&#383;acres? and, at the very
moment I am writing, new ones are premeditated. They call
vehemently for &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion, and obedience to the
laws, but the laws had never le&#383;&#383; influence; and while
our compliance with &#383;uch as we are even ignorant of is
exacted, it is accounted a crime to execute tho&#383;e in force.
Every municipality has its own arbitrary code&mdash;every
battalion, every private &#383;oldier, exerci&#383;es a
&#383;overeignty, a mo&#383;t ab&#383;olute de&#383;poti&#383;m;
and yet the Gazettes do not cea&#383;e to boa&#383;t the excellence
of &#383;uch a government. They have, one and all, attributed the
ma&#383;&#383;acres of the tenth of Augu&#383;t and the &#383;econd
of September, and the days following each, to a popular
fermentation. The mon&#383;ter&#383;! they have been careful not to
tell us, that each of the&#383;e horrid &#383;cenes (at the
pri&#383;ons, at La Force, at the Abbaye, &amp;c. &amp;c.) was
pre&#383;ided by municipal officers in their &#383;carfs, who
pointed out the victims, and gave the &#383;ignal for the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination. It wa&#383; (continue the
Journals) the error of an irritated people&mdash;and yet their
magi&#383;trates were at the head of it: it was a momentary error;
yet this error of a moment continued during &#383;ix whole days of
the coole&#383;t reflection&mdash;it was only at the clo&#383;e of
the &#383;eventh that Petion made his appearance, and affected to
per&#383;uade the people to de&#383;i&#383;t. The
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins left off only from fatigue, and at
thi&#383; moment they are preparing to begin again. The Journals do
not tell us that the chief of the&#383;e <i>Scelerat&#383;</i> [We
have no term in the Engli&#383;h language that conveys an adequate
meaning for this word&mdash;it &#383;eems to expre&#383;s the
extreme of human wickedne&#383;s and atrocity.] employed
&#383;ubordinate a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins, whom they
cau&#383;ed to be clande&#383;tinely murdered in their turn, as
though they hoped to de&#383;troy the proof of their crime, and
e&#383;cape the vengeance that awaits them. But the people
them&#383;elves were accomplices in the deed, for the Garde
Nationale gave their a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance,'" &amp;c.

<p>In &#383;pite of the murder of &#383;o many journali&#383;ts,
and the de&#383;truction of the printing-offices, it treats the
September bu&#383;ine&#383;s &#383;o freely, that the editor will
doubtle&#383;s &#383;oon be &#383;ilenced. Admitting the&#383;e
accu&#383;ations to be unfounded, what ideas mu&#383;t the people
have of their magi&#383;trates, when they are credited? It is the
prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of the hearer that give&#383;
authenticity to fiction; and &#383;uch atrocities would neither be
imputed to, nor believed of, men not already bad.&mdash;Yours,

<h2>December, 1792.</h2>
<p>Dear Brother,</p>
<p>All the public prints &#383;till continue &#383;trongly to
in&#383;inuate, that England is prepared for an in&#383;urrection,
and Scotland already in actual rebellion: but I know the character
of our countrymen too well to be per&#383;uaded that they have
adopted new principles as ea&#383;ily as they would adopt a new
mode, or that the vi&#383;ionary anarchi&#383;ts of the French
government can have made many pro&#383;elytes among an humane and
rational people. For many years we were content to let France
remain the arbitre&#383;s of the lighter departments of ta&#383;te:
lately &#383;he has ceded thi&#383; province to us, and England has
dictated with unconte&#383;ted &#383;uperiority. This I cannot
think very &#383;trange; for the eye in time becomes fatigued by
elaborate finery, and requires only the introduction of &#383;imple
elegance to be attracted by it. But if, while we export
fa&#383;hions to this country, we &#383;hould receive in exchange
her republican &#383;y&#383;tems, it would be a &#383;trange
revolution indeed; and I think, in &#383;uch a commerce, we
&#383;hould be far from finding the balance in our favour. I have,
in fact, little &#383;olicitude about the&#383;e diurnal
fal&#383;ehoods, though I am not altogether free from alarm as to
their tendency. I cannot help &#383;u&#383;pecting it is to
influence the people to a belief that &#383;uch
di&#383;po&#383;itions exi&#383;t in England as preclude the danger
of a war, in ca&#383;e it &#383;hould be thought
nece&#383;&#383;ary to &#383;acrifice the King.</p>
<p>I am more confirmed in this opinion, from the recent
di&#383;covery, with the circum&#383;tances attending it, of a
&#383;ecret iron che&#383;t at the Tuilleries. The man who had been
employed to con&#383;truct this rece&#383;s, informs the
mini&#383;ter, Rolland; who, in&#383;tead of communicating the
matter to the Convention, as it was very natural he &#383;hould do
on an occa&#383;ion of &#383;o much importance, and requiring it to
be opened in the pre&#383;ence of proper witne&#383;&#383;es, goes
privately him&#383;elf, takes the papers found into his own
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion, and then makes an application for a
committee to examine them. Under the&#383;e &#383;u&#383;picious
and my&#383;terious appearances, we are told that many letters,
&amp;c. are found, which inculpate the King; and perhap&#383; the
fate of this unfortunate Monarch is to be decided by evidence not
admi&#383;&#383;ible with ju&#383;tice in the ca&#383;e of the
ob&#383;cure&#383;t malefactor. Yet Rolland is the hero of a party
who call him, par excellence, the virtuou&#383; Rolland! Perhaps
you will think, with me, that this epithet i&#383; mi&#383;applied
to a man who has ri&#383;en, from an ob&#383;cure &#383;ituation to
that of fir&#383;t Mini&#383;ter, without being
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of talents of that brilliant or
prominent cla&#383;s which &#383;ometimes force them&#383;elves
into notice, without the aid of wealth or the &#383;upport of
patronage.</p>
<p>Rolland was in&#383;pector of manufactories in this place, and
afterwards at Lyons; and I do not go too far in advancing, that a
man of very rigid virtue could not, from &#383;uch a &#383;tation,
have attained &#383;o &#383;uddenly the one he now
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;es. Virtue is of an unvarying and
inflexible nature: it di&#383;dains as much to be the flatterer of
mobs, as the adulator of Princes: yet how often mu&#383;t he, who
ri&#383;es &#383;o far above his equals, have &#383;tooped below
them? How often mu&#383;t he have &#383;acrificed both his
rea&#383;on and hi&#383; principles? How often have yielded to the
little, and oppo&#383;ed the great, not from conviction, but
intere&#383;t? For in this the meane&#383;t of mankind
re&#383;emble the mo&#383;t exalted; he be&#383;tows not his
confidence on him who re&#383;i&#383;ts his will, nor
&#383;ub&#383;cribes to the advancement of one whom he doe&#383;
not hope to influence.&mdash;I may almo&#383;t venture to add, that
more di&#383;&#383;imulation, meaner conce&#383;&#383;ions, and
more tortuous policy, are requi&#383;ite to become the idol of the
people, than are practi&#383;ed to acquire and pre&#383;erve the
favour of the mo&#383;t potent Monarch in Europe. The French,
however, do not argue in this manner, and Rolland is at
pre&#383;ent very popular, and his popularity is &#383;aid to be
greatly &#383;upported by the literary talents of his wife.</p>
<p>I know not if you rightly under&#383;tand the&#383;e party
di&#383;tinctions among a &#383;et of men whom you mu&#383;t regard
as united in the common cau&#383;e of e&#383;tabli&#383;hing a
republic in France, but you have &#383;ometimes had occa&#383;ion
to remark in England, that many may amicably concur in the
accompli&#383;hment of a work, who differ extremely about the
participation of its advantages; and thi&#383; is already the
ca&#383;e with the Convention. Tho&#383;e who at pre&#383;ent
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383; all the power, and are infinitely the
&#383;tronge&#383;t, are wits, morali&#383;ts, and
philo&#383;ophers by profe&#383;&#383;ion, having
Bri&#383;&#383;ot, Rolland, Petion, Concorcet, &amp;c. at their
head; their opponents are adventurers of a more de&#383;perate
ca&#383;t, who make up by violence what they want in numbers, and
are led by Robe&#383;pierre, Danton, Chabot, &amp;c. &amp;c. The
only di&#383;tinction of the&#383;e parties is, I believe, that the
fir&#383;t are vain and &#383;y&#383;tematical hypocrites, who have
originally corrupted the minds of the people by vi&#383;ionary and
in&#383;idious doctrines, and now maintain their &#383;uperiority
by artifice and intrigue: their opponents, equally wicked, and more
daring, ju&#383;tify that turpitude which the others &#383;eek to
di&#383;gui&#383;e, and appear almo&#383;t as bad as they are. The
credulous people are duped by both; while the cunning of the one,
and the vehemence of the other, alternately prevail.&mdash;But
&#383;omething too much of politics, as my de&#383;ign is in
general rather to mark their effect on the people, than to enter on
more immediate di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ions.</p>
<p>Having been at the Criminal Tribunal to-day, I now recollect
that I have never yet de&#383;cribed to you the co&#383;tume of the
French Judges.&mdash;Perhap&#383; when I have before had
occa&#383;ion to &#383;peak of it, your imagination may have glided
to We&#383;tmin&#383;ter Hall, and depicted to you the &#383;carlet
robes and voluminous wigs of its re&#383;pectable magi&#383;trates:
but if you would form an idea of a magi&#383;trate here, you
mu&#383;t bring your mind to the ab&#383;traction of Crambo, and
figure to your&#383;elf a Judge without either gown, wig, or any of
tho&#383;e venerable appendages. Nothing indeed can be more
becoming or gallant, than this judicial accoutrement&mdash;it is
black, with a &#383;ilk cloak of the &#383;ame colour, in the
Spani&#383;h form, and a round hat, turned up before, with a large
plume of black feathers. This, when the magi&#383;trate happens to
be young, has a very theatrical and romantic appearance; but when
it is worn by a figure a little E&#383;opian, or with a large
bu&#383;hy perriwig, as I have &#383;ometimes &#383;een it, the
effect is &#383;till le&#383;s awful; and a &#383;tranger, on
&#383;eeing &#383;uch an apparition in the &#383;treet, is tempted
to &#383;uppo&#383;e it a period of jubilee, and that the
inhabitants are in ma&#383;querade.</p>
<p>It is now the cu&#383;tom for all people to addre&#383;s each
other by the appellation of Citizen; and whether you are a citizen
or not&mdash;whether you inhabit Paris, or are a native of
Peru&mdash;&#383;till it is an indication of ari&#383;tocracy,
either to exact, or to u&#383;e, any other title. This is all
congruous with the &#383;y&#383;tem of the day: the abu&#383;es are
real, the reform i&#383; imaginary. The people are flattered with
&#383;ounds, while they are lo&#383;ing in e&#383;&#383;entials.
And the permi&#383;&#383;ion to apply the appellation of Citizen to
its members, is but a poor compen&#383;ation for the
de&#383;poti&#383;m of a department or a municipality.</p>
<p>In vain are the people flattered with a chimerical
equality&mdash;it cannot exi&#383;t in a civilized &#383;tate, and
if it could exi&#383;t any where, it would not be in France. The
French are habituated to &#383;ubordination&mdash;they naturally
look up to &#383;omething &#383;uperior&mdash;and when one
cla&#383;s is degraded, it is only to give place to another.</p>
<p>&mdash;The pride of the noble&#383;&#383;e is &#383;ucceeded by
the pride of the merchant&mdash; the influence of wealth is again
realized by cheap purcha&#383;es of the national
domain&#383;&mdash;the abandoned abbey becomes the delight of the
opulent trader, and replaces the demoli&#383;hed chateau of the
feudal in&#383;titution. Full of the importance which the
commercial intere&#383;t is to acquire under a republic, the
wealthy man of bu&#383;ine&#383;s is ea&#383;ily reconciled to the
oppre&#383;&#383;ion of the &#383;uperior cla&#383;&#383;es, and
enjoys, with great dignity, hi&#383; new elevation. The
counting-hou&#383;e of a manufacturer of woollen cloth i&#383; as
inacce&#383;&#383;ible as the boudoir of a Marquis; while the
flowered brocade gown and well-powdered curls of the former offer a
much more impo&#383;ing exterior than the chintz robe de chambre
and di&#383;hevelled locks of the more affable man of
fa&#383;hion.</p>
<p>I have read, in &#383;ome French author, a maxim to this
effect:&mdash;"Act with your friends as though they &#383;hould one
day be your enemies;" and the exi&#383;ting government &#383;eems
amply to have profited by the admonition of their country-man: for
notwith&#383;tanding they affirm, that all France &#383;upports,
and all England admires them, this does not prevent their
exerci&#383;ing a mo&#383;t vigilant inqui&#383;ition over the
inhabitants of both countries.&mdash;It is already
&#383;agaciou&#383;ly hinted, that Mr. Thomas Paine may be a
&#383;py, and every hou&#383;eholder who receives a lodger or
vi&#383;itor, and every proprietor who lets a hou&#383;e, is
obliged to regi&#383;ter the names of tho&#383;e he entertains, or
who are his tenants, and to become re&#383;pon&#383;ible for their
conduct. This is done at the municipality, and all who thu&#383;
venture to change their re&#383;idence, of whatever age, &#383;ex,
or condition, mu&#383;t pre&#383;ent them&#383;elves, and
&#383;ubmit to an examination. The power of the municipalities is
indeed very great; and as they are chiefly &#383;elected from the
lower cla&#383;s of &#383;hop-keepers, you may conclude that their
authority is not exerci&#383;ed with much politene&#383;s or
moderation.</p>
<p>The timid or indolent inhabitant of London, who&#383;e head has
been filled with the Ba&#383;tilles and police of the ancient
government, and who would a&#383; &#383;oon have ventured to
Con&#383;tantinople as to Paris, reads, in the debate&#383; of the
Convention, that France is now the freee&#383;t country in the
world, and that &#383;trangers from all corners of it flock to
offer their adoration&#383; in this new Temple of Liberty. Allured
by the&#383;e de&#383;criptions, he re&#383;olves on the journey,
willing, for once in his life, to enjoy a ta&#383;te of the
ble&#383;&#383;ing in &#383;ublimate, which he now learns has
hitherto been allowed him only in the gro&#383;s element.&mdash;He
experiences a thou&#383;and impo&#383;itions on landing with his
baggage at Calais, but he &#383;ubmits to them without murmuring,
becau&#383;e his countrymen at Dover had, on hi&#383; embarkation,
already kindly initiated him into this &#383;cience of taxing the
inqui&#383;itive &#383;pirit of travellers. After in&#383;cribing
his name, and rewarding the cu&#383;tom-hou&#383;e officers for
rummaging his portmanteau, he determines to amu&#383;e him&#383;elf
with a walk about the town. The fir&#383;t centinel he encounters
&#383;tops him, becau&#383;e he has no cockade: he
purcha&#383;e&#383; one at the next &#383;hop, (paying according to
the exigency of the ca&#383;e,) and is &#383;uffered to pa&#383;s
on. When he has &#383;ettled his bill at the Auberge "a
l'Angloi&#383;e," and emagines he has nothing to do but to
pur&#383;ue his journey, he finds he has yet to procure
him&#383;elf a pa&#383;&#383;port. He waits an hour and an half for
an officer, who at length appears, and with a rule in one hand, and
a pen in the other, begins to mea&#383;ure the height, and take an
inventory of the features of the a&#383;toni&#383;hed
&#383;tranger. By the time thi&#383; ceremony is fini&#383;hed, the
gates are &#383;hut, and he can proceed no farther, till the
morrow. He departs early, and is awakened twice on the road to
Boulogne to produce his pa&#383;&#383;port: &#383;till, however, he
keeps his temper, concluding, that the new light has not yet made
its way to the frontiers, and that the&#383;e trouble&#383;ome
precautions may be nece&#383;&#383;ary near a port. He continues
his route, and, by degrees, becomes habituated to this regimen of
liberty; till, perhaps, on the &#383;econd day, the validity of
hi&#383; pa&#383;&#383;port is di&#383;puted, the municipality who
granted it have the reputation of ari&#383;tocracy, or the whole is
informal, and he mu&#383;t be content to wait while a
me&#383;&#383;enger is di&#383;patched to have it rectified, and
the officer&#383; e&#383;tabli&#383;h the &#383;everity of their
patrioti&#383;m at the expence of the &#383;tranger.</p>
<p>Our traveller, at length, permitted to depart, feels his
patience wonderfully dimini&#383;hed, execrates the regulations of
the coa&#383;t, and the ignorance of &#383;mall towns, and
determines to &#383;top a few days and ob&#383;erve the
progre&#383;s of freedom at Ameins. Being a large commercial place,
he here expects to behold all the happy effects of the new
con&#383;titution; he congratulates him&#383;elf on travelling at a
period when he can procure information, and di&#383;cu&#383;s his
political opinions, unannoyed by fears of &#383;tate pri&#383;ons,
and &#383;pies of the police. His landlord, however, acquaint&#383;
him, that his appearance at the Town Hou&#383;e cannot be
di&#383;pen&#383;ed with&mdash;he attends three or four different
hours of appointment, and is each time &#383;ent away, (after
waiting half an hour with the valets de ville in the antichamber,)
and told that the municipal officers are engaged. As an
Engli&#383;hman, he has little reli&#383;h for the&#383;e
&#383;ubordinate &#383;overeigns, and difficult
audience&#383;&mdash;he hints at the next coffee-hou&#383;e that he
had imagined a &#383;tranger might have re&#383;ted two days in a
free country, without being mea&#383;ured, and que&#383;tioned, and
without detailing his hi&#383;tory, a&#383; though he were
&#383;u&#383;pected of de&#383;ertion; and ventures on &#383;ome
implied compari&#383;on between the ancient "Mon&#383;ieur le
Commandant," and the modern "Citoyen Maire."&mdash;To his utter
a&#383;toni&#383;hment he finds, that though there are no longer
emi&#383;&#383;aries of the police, there are Jacobin informers;
hi&#383; di&#383;cour&#383;e is reported to the municipality, his
bu&#383;ine&#383;s in the town becomes the &#383;ubject of
conjecture, he is concluded to be <i>"un homme &#383;an&#383;
aveu,"</i> [One that can't give a good account of him&#383;elf.]
and arre&#383;ted a&#383; "&#383;u&#383;pect;" and it is not
without the interference of the people to whom he may have been
recommended at Paris, that he is relea&#383;ed, and enabled to
continue his journey.</p>
<p>At Paris he lives in perpetual alarm. One night he is
di&#383;turbed by a vi&#383;ite domiciliaire, another by a
riot&mdash;one day the people are in in&#383;urrection for bread,
and the next murdering each other at a public fe&#383;tival; and
our country-man, even after making every allowance for the
confu&#383;ion of a recent change, thinks him&#383;elf very
fortunate if he reache&#383; England in &#383;afety, and will, for
the re&#383;t of his life, be &#383;ati&#383;fied with &#383;uch a
degree of liberty as is &#383;ecured to him by the
con&#383;titution of hi&#383; own country.</p>
<p>You &#383;ee I have no de&#383;ign of tempting you to pay us a
vi&#383;it; and, to &#383;peak the truth, I think tho&#383;e who
are in England will &#383;how their wi&#383;dom by remaining there.
Nothing but the &#383;tate of Mrs. D____'s health, and her dread of
the &#383;ea at this time of the year, detains us; for every day
&#383;ubtracts from my courage, and adds to my
apprehen&#383;ions.</p>
<p>&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Amiens, January, 1793.</h2>
<p>Vanity, I believe, my dear brother, is not &#383;o innoxious a
quality as we are de&#383;irous of &#383;uppo&#383;ing. As it is
the mo&#383;t general of all human failings, &#383;o is it regarded
with the mo&#383;t indulgence: a latent
con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s averts the cen&#383;ure of the weak;
and the wi&#383;e, who flatter them&#383;elves with being exempt
from it, plead in its favour, by ranking it as a foible too light
for &#383;erious condemnation, or too inoffen&#383;ive for
puni&#383;hment. Yet, if vanity be not an actual vice, it is
certainly a potential one&mdash;it often leads us to &#383;eek
reputation rather than virtue, to &#383;ub&#383;titute appearances
for realities, and to prefer the eulogiums of the world to the
approbation of our own minds. When it takes
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of an uninformed or an
ill-con&#383;tituted mind, it becomes the &#383;ource of a
thou&#383;and errors, and a thou&#383;and ab&#383;urdities. Hence,
youth &#383;eeks a preeminence in vice, and age in folly; hence,
many boa&#383;t of errors they would not commit, or claim
di&#383;tinction by inve&#383;ting them&#383;elves with an
imputation of exce&#383;s in &#383;ome popular
ab&#383;urdity&mdash;duels are courted by the daring, and vaunted
by the coward&mdash;he who trembles at the idea of death and a
future &#383;tate when alone, proclaims him&#383;elf an
athei&#383;t or a free-thinker in public&mdash;the water-drinker,
who &#383;uffers the penitence of a week for a &#383;upernumerary
gla&#383;s, recounts the wonders of hi&#383; intemperance&mdash;and
he who does not mount the gentle&#383;t animal without trepidation,
plumes him&#383;elf on breaking down hor&#383;es, and his perils in
the chace. In &#383;hort, whatever order of mankind we contemplate,
we &#383;hall perceive that the portion of vanity allotted us by
nature, when it i&#383; not corrected by a &#383;ound judgement,
and rendered &#383;ub&#383;ervient to u&#383;eful purpo&#383;es, is
&#383;ure either to degrade or mi&#383;lead us.</p>
<p>I was led into this train of reflection by the conduct of our
Anglo-Gallican legi&#383;lator, Mr. Thomas Paine. He has lately
compo&#383;ed a &#383;peech, which was tran&#383;lated and read in
his pre&#383;ence, (doubtle&#383;s to hi&#383; great
&#383;ati&#383;faction,) in which he in&#383;i&#383;ts with much
vehemence on the nece&#383;&#383;ity of trying the King; and he
even, with little credit to hi&#383; humanity, gives intimations of
pre&#383;umed guilt. Yet I do not &#383;u&#383;pect Mr. Paine to be
of a cruel or unmerciful nature; and, mo&#383;t probably, vanity
alone has in&#383;tigated him to a proceeding which, one would
wi&#383;h to believe, his heart di&#383;approves. Tired of the part
he was playing, and which, it mu&#383;t be confe&#383;&#383;ed, was
not calculated to flatter the cen&#383;urer of Kings and the
reformer of con&#383;titutions, he determined to &#383;it no longer
for whole hours in colloquy with his interpreter, or in mute
contemplation, like the Chancellor in the Critic; and the
&#383;peech to which I have alluded was compo&#383;ed. Knowing that
lenient opinions would meet no applau&#383;e from the tribunes, he
inli&#383;ts him&#383;elf on the &#383;ide of &#383;everity,
accu&#383;es all the Princes in the world as the accomplices of
Louis the Sixteenth, expre&#383;&#383;es his de&#383;ire for an
univer&#383;al revolution, and, after previou&#383;ly
a&#383;&#383;uring the Convention the King is guilty, recommends
that they may in&#383;tantly proceed to his trial. But, after all
this tremendous eloquence, perhaps Mr. Paine had no malice in his
heart: he may only be &#383;olicitous to pre&#383;erve his
reputation from decay, and to indulge his &#383;elf-importance by
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ting at the trial of a Monarch whom he may not
wi&#383;h to &#383;uffer.&mdash;I think, therefore, I am not wrong
in a&#383;&#383;erting, that Vanity is a very mi&#383;chievous
coun&#383;ellor.</p>
<p>The little di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es I formerly complained of,
as ari&#383;ing from the paper currency, are nearly removed by a
plentiful emi&#383;&#383;ion of &#383;mall a&#383;&#383;ignats, and
we have now pompous a&#383;&#383;ignments on the national domains
for ten &#383;ols: we have, likewi&#383;e, pieces coined from the
church bells in circulation, but mo&#383;t of the&#383;e
di&#383;appear as &#383;oon as i&#383;&#383;ued. You would
&#383;carcely imagine that this copper is deemed worthy to be
hoarded; yet &#383;uch is the people's aver&#383;ion from the
paper, and &#383;uch their mi&#383;tru&#383;t of the government,
that not an hou&#383;ewife will part with one of the&#383;e
piece&#383; while &#383;he has an a&#383;&#383;ignat in her
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion; and tho&#383;e who are rich enough
to keep a few livres by them, ama&#383;s and bury this copper
trea&#383;ure with the utmo&#383;t &#383;olicitude and
&#383;ecre&#383;y.</p>
<p>A tolerably accurate &#383;cale of the national confidence might
be made, by marking the progre&#383;s of the&#383;e
&#383;u&#383;picious interments. Under the fir&#383;t
A&#383;&#383;embly, people began to hide their gold; during the
reign of the &#383;econd they took the &#383;ame affectionate care
of their &#383;ilver; and, &#383;ince the meeting of the
Convention, they &#383;eem equally anxious to hide any metal they
can get. If one were to de&#383;cribe the pre&#383;ent age, one
might, as far as regards France, call it, both literally and
metaphorically, the Iron Age; for it is certain, the character of
the times would ju&#383;tify the metaphoric application, and the
di&#383;appearance of every other metal the literal one. As the
French are fond of cla&#383;&#383;ic examples, I &#383;hall not be
&#383;urprized to &#383;ee an iron coinage, in imitation of Sparta,
though they &#383;eem in the way of having one rea&#383;on
le&#383;s for &#383;uch a mea&#383;ure than the Spartans had, for
they are already in a &#383;tate to defy corruption; and if they
were not, I think a war with England would &#383;ecure the purity
of their morals from being endangered by too much commercial
intercour&#383;e.</p>
<p>I cannot be di&#383;plea&#383;ed with the civil things you
&#383;ay of my letters, nor at your valuing them &#383;o much as to
pre&#383;erve them; though, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, this fraternal
gallantry is not nece&#383;&#383;ary, on the account you intimate,
nor will our countrymen &#383;uffer, in my opinion, by any
compari&#383;ons I can make here. Your ideas of French gallantry
are, indeed, very erroneou&#383;&mdash; it may differ in the manner
from that practi&#383;ed in England, but is far from having any
claim to &#383;uperiority. Perhaps I cannot define the
preten&#383;ions of the two nations in this re&#383;pect better
than by &#383;aying, that the gallantry of an Engli&#383;hman is a
&#383;entiment&mdash;that of a Frenchman a &#383;y&#383;tem. The
fir&#383;t, if a lady happen to be old or plain, or indifferent to
him, is apt to limit his attentions to re&#383;pect, or
utility&mdash;now the latter never troubles him&#383;elf with
the&#383;e di&#383;tinctions: he is repul&#383;ed by no extremity
of years, nor deformity of feature; he adores, with equal ardour,
both young and old, nor is either often &#383;hocked by his
vi&#383;ible preference of the other. I have &#383;een a youthful
beau ki&#383;s, with perfect devotion, a ball of cotton dropped
from the hand of a lady who wa&#383; knitting &#383;tockings for
her grand-children. Another pays his court to a belle in her
climacteric, by bringing <i>gimblette&#383;</i> [A &#383;ort of
gingerbread.] to the favourite lap-dog, or attending, with great
a&#383;&#383;iduity, the egre&#383;&#383;es and regre&#383;&#383;es
of her angola, who paces &#383;lowly out of the room ten times in
an hour, while the door is held open by the complai&#383;ant
Frenchman with a mo&#383;t re&#383;pectful gravity.</p>
<p>Thus, you &#383;ee, France is to the old what a ma&#383;querade
is to the ugly &mdash;the one confounds the di&#383;parity of age
as the other does that of per&#383;on; but indi&#383;criminate
adoration is no compliment to youth, nor is a ma&#383;k any
privilege to beauty. We may therefore conclude, that though France
may be the Ely&#383;ium of old women, England is that of the young.
When I fir&#383;t came into this country, it reminded me of an
i&#383;land I had read of in the Arabian Tales, where the ladies
were not deemed in their bloom till they verged towards
&#383;eventy; and I conceived the project of inviting all the
belles, who had been half a century out of fa&#383;hion in England,
to cro&#383;s the Channel, and begin a new career of
admiration!&mdash; Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Amiens, 1793.</h2>
<p>Dear Brother,</p>
<p>I have thought it hitherto a &#383;elf evident
propo&#383;ition&mdash;that of all the principles which can be
inculcated in the human mind, that of liberty i&#383; lea&#383;t
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of propagation by force. Yet a Council of
Philo&#383;opher&#383; (di&#383;ciples of Rou&#383;&#383;eau and
Voltaire) have &#383;ent forth Dumouriez, at the head of an hundred
thou&#383;and men, to in&#383;truct the people of Flanders in the
doctrine of freedom. Such a mi&#383;&#383;ionary is indeed
invincible, and the defencele&#383;s towns of the Low Countries
have been converted and pillaged [By the civil agents of the
executive power.] by a benevolent cru&#383;ade of the philanthropic
a&#383;&#383;ertors of the rights of man. The&#383;e warlike
Propagandi&#383;tes, however, do not always convince without
experiencing re&#383;i&#383;tance, and ignorance &#383;ometimes
oppo&#383;es, with great ob&#383;tinacy, the progre&#383;s of
truth. The logic of Dumouriez did not enforce conviction at
Gemappe, but at the expence of fifteen thou&#383;and of his own
army, and, doubtle&#383;s, a proportionate number of the
unconverted.</p>
<p>Here let me forbear every expre&#383;&#383;ion tending to
levity: the heart recoil&#383; at &#383;uch a &#383;laughter of
human victims; and, if a momentary &#383;mile be excited by
the&#383;e Quixoti&#383;ms, it is checked by horror at their
con&#383;equence&#383;!&mdash;Humanity will lament &#383;uch
de&#383;truction; but it will likewi&#383;e be indignant to learn,
that, in the official account of thi&#383; battle, the killed were
e&#383;timated at three hundred, and the wounded at
&#383;ix!&mdash;But, if the people be &#383;acrificed, they are not
deceived. The di&#383;abled &#383;ufferers, who are returning to
their homes in different part&#383; of the republic, betray the
turpitude of the government, and expo&#383;e the fallacy of
the&#383;e bloodle&#383;s victories of the gazettes. The pedants of
the Convention are not unlearned in the hi&#383;tory of the
Praetorian Bands and the omnipotence of armies; and an
offen&#383;ive war is undertaken to give occupation to the
&#383;oldiers, who&#383;e inactivity might produce reflection, or
who&#383;e di&#383;content might prove fatal to the new order of
things.&mdash;Attempt&#383; are made to divert the public mind from
the real mi&#383;ery experienced at home, by relations of
u&#383;ele&#383;s conque&#383;ts abroad; the &#383;ub&#383;tantial
lo&#383;&#383;es, which are the price of the&#383;e imaginary
benefits, are palliated or concealed; and the circum&#383;tances of
an engagement is known but by individual communication, and when
&#383;ub&#383;equent events have nearly effaced the remembrance of
it.&mdash;By the&#383;e artifices, and from motives at lea&#383;t
not better, and, perhaps, wor&#383;e than tho&#383;e I have
mentioned, will population be dimini&#383;hed, and agriculture
impeded: France will be involved in pre&#383;ent
di&#383;tre&#383;s, and con&#383;igned to future want; and the
deluded people be puni&#383;hed in the mi&#383;eries of their own
country, becau&#383;e their unprincipled rulers have judged it
expedient to carry war and deva&#383;tation into another.</p>
<p>One of the di&#383;tingui&#383;hing features in the French
character is <i>&#383;ang froid</i> &mdash;&#383;carcely a day
pa&#383;&#383;es that it does not force it&#383;elf on one'&#383;
ob&#383;ervation. It is not confined to the thinking part of the
people, who know that pa&#383;&#383;ion and irritability avail
nothing; nor to tho&#383;e who, not thinking at all, are, of
cour&#383;e, not moved by any thing: but is equally
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed by every rank and condition, whether
you cla&#383;s them by their mental endowments, or their temporal
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ions. They not only (as, it mu&#383;t be
confe&#383;&#383;ed, is too commonly the ca&#383;e in all
countries,) bear the calamities of their friends with great
philo&#383;ophy, but are nearly a&#383; rea&#383;onable under the
pre&#383;&#383;ure of their own. The grief of a Frenchman, at
lea&#383;t, partakes of his imputed national complai&#383;ance,
and, far from intruding it&#383;elf on &#383;ociety, is always
ready to accept of con&#383;olation, and join in amu&#383;ement. If
you &#383;ay your wife or relations are dead, they replay coldly,
<i>"Il faut &#383;e con&#383;oler:"</i> or if they vi&#383;it you
in an illne&#383;s, <i>"Il faut prendre patience."</i> Or tell them
you are ruined, and their features then become &#383;omething more
attenuated, the &#383;houlder&#383; &#383;omething more elevated,
and a more commi&#383;erating tone confe&#383;&#383;es,
<i>"C'e&#383;t bien mal beureux&mdash;Mai enfin que voulez
vous?"</i> ["It's unlucky, but what can be &#383;aid in &#383;uch
ca&#383;es?"] and in the &#383;ame in&#383;tant they ill recount
&#383;ome good fortune at a card party, or expatiate on the
excellence of a ragout.&mdash;Yet, to do them ju&#383;tice, they
only offer for your comfort the &#383;ame arguments they would have
found efficacious in promoting their own.</p>
<p>This di&#383;po&#383;ition, which pre&#383;erves the
tranquillity of the rich, indurate&#383; the &#383;en&#383;e of
wretchedne&#383;s in the poor; it &#383;upplies the place of
fortitude in the one, and that of patience in the other; and, while
it enables both to endure their own particular
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es, it makes them &#383;ubmit quietly to a
weight and exce&#383;s of public evils, which any nation but their
own would &#383;ink under, or re&#383;i&#383;t. Among&#383;t
&#383;hopkeepers, &#383;ervants, &amp;c. without incurring
per&#383;onal odium, it has the effect of what would be deemed in
England impenetrable a&#383;&#383;urance. It forces
pertinaceou&#383;ly an article not wanted, and pre&#383;erves the
inflexibility of the features at a detected impo&#383;ition: it
in&#383;pires &#383;ervants with arguments in defence of every
mi&#383;demeanour in the whole dome&#383;tic catalogue; it renders
them in&#383;en&#383;ible either of their negligences or the
con&#383;equences of them; and endows them with a happy facility of
contradicting with the mo&#383;t ob&#383;equiou&#383;
politene&#383;s.</p>
<p>A gentleman of our acquaintances dined at a table d'Hote, where
the company were annoyed by a very uncommon and offen&#383;ive
&#383;mell. On cutting up a fowl, they di&#383;covered the
&#383;mell to have been occa&#383;ioned by its being
dre&#383;&#383;ed with out any other preparation than that of
depluming. They immediately &#383;ent for the ho&#383;t, and told
him, that the fowl had been dre&#383;&#383;ed without having been
drawn: but, far from appearing di&#383;concerted, as one might
expect, he only replied, <i>"Cela &#383;e pourroit bien,
Mon&#383;ieur."</i> ["'Tis very po&#383;&#383;ible, Sir."] Now an
Engli&#383;h Boniface, even though he had already made his fortune,
would have been mortified at &#383;uch an incident, and all his
eloquence would &#383;carcely have produced an unfaultering
apology.</p>
<p>Whether this national indifference originate in a phy&#383;ical
or a moral cau&#383;e, from an obtu&#383;ene&#383;s in their
corporeal formation or a perfection in their intellectual one, I do
not pretend to decide; but whatever be the cau&#383;e, the effect
is enjoyed with great mode&#383;ty. So little do the French pique
them&#383;elves on this valuable &#383;toici&#383;m, that they
acknowledge being more &#383;ubject to that human weakne&#383;s
called feeling, than any other people in the world. All their
writers abound in pathetic exclamations, &#383;entimental
phra&#383;es, and allu&#383;ions to "la &#383;en&#383;ibilite
Francai&#383;e," a&#383; though they imagined it proverbial. You
can &#383;carcely hold a conver&#383;ation with a Frenchman without
hearing him detail, with an expre&#383;&#383;ion of feature not
always analogous, many very affecting &#383;entences. He i&#383;
<i>de&#383;ole, de&#383;e&#383;pere, or afflige</i>&mdash;he has
<i>le coeur trop &#383;en&#383;ible, le coeur &#383;erre, or le
coeur navre;</i> [Afflicted&mdash;in de&#383;pair&mdash;too feeling
a heart&mdash; his heart is wrung or wounded.] and the well-placing
of the&#383;e dolorou&#383; a&#383;&#383;ertions depends rather
upon the judgement and eloquence of the &#383;peaker, than the
&#383;eriou&#383;ne&#383;s of the ca&#383;e which gives ri&#383;e
to them. For in&#383;tance, the de&#383;pair and de&#383;olation of
him who has lo&#383;t his money, and of him who&#383;e head is ill
dre&#383;t, are of different degrees, but the expre&#383;&#383;ions
are u&#383;ually the &#383;ame. The debates of the Convention, the
debates of the Jacobins, and all the public prints, are fraught
with proofs of this appropriated &#383;u&#383;ceptibility, and it
is often attributed to per&#383;ons and occa&#383;ions where we
&#383;hould not much expect to find it. A quarrel between the
legi&#383;lators as to who was mo&#383;t concerned in promoting the
ma&#383;&#383;acres of September, is reconciled with a "&#383;weet
and enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic exce&#383;s of fraternal
tenderne&#383;s." When the clubs di&#383;pute on the expediency of
an in&#383;urrection, or the nece&#383;&#383;ity of a more frequent
employment of the guillotine, the debate terminates by overflowing
of &#383;en&#383;ibility from all the members who have engaged in
it!</p>
<p>At the a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inations in one of the
pri&#383;ons, when all the other mi&#383;erable victims had
peri&#383;hed, the mob di&#383;covered one Jonneau, a member of the
A&#383;&#383;embly, who had been confined for kicking another
member named Grangeneuve.* As the ma&#383;&#383;acrers probably had
no orders on the &#383;ubject, he was brought forth, from
amid&#383;t heaps of murdered companions, and a me&#383;&#383;enger
di&#383;patched to the A&#383;&#383;embly, (which during the&#383;e
&#383;cenes met a&#383; u&#383;ual,) to enquire if they
acknowledged Jonneau as a member. A decree was pa&#383;&#383;ed in
the affirmative, and Jonneau brought by the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins, with the decree fa&#383;tened on his
brea&#383;t, in triumph to his colleagues, who, we are told, at
this in&#383;tance of re&#383;pect for them&#383;elves, &#383;hed
tears of tenderne&#383;s and admiration at the conduct of
mon&#383;ters, the &#383;ight of whom &#383;hould &#383;eem
revolting to human nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* When the ma&#383;&#383;acres began, the wife and
friends of Jonneau petitioned Grangeneuve on their knees to
con&#383;ent to his enlargement; but Grangeneuve was implacable,
and Jonneau continued in pri&#383;on till relea&#383;ed by the
means above mentioned. It is ob&#383;ervable, that at this dreadful
moment the utmo&#383;t &#383;trictne&#383;s was ob&#383;erved, and
every form literally enforced in granting the di&#383;charge of a
pri&#383;oner. A &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;ion of all laws, human and
divine, was allowed to the a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins, while
tho&#383;e only that &#383;ecured them their victims were rigidly
adhered to.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the real &#383;ang froid I have before noticed, and
the&#383;e preten&#383;ion&#383; to &#383;en&#383;ibility, are a
natural con&#383;equence one or the other. It is the hi&#383;tory
of the bea&#383;t's confe&#383;&#383;ion&mdash;we have only to be
particularly deficient in any quality, to make us &#383;olicitous
for the reputation of it; and after a long habit of deceiving
others we fini&#383;h by deceiving our&#383;elves. He who feels no
compa&#383;&#383;ion for the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es of hi&#383;
neighbour, knows that &#383;uch indifference is not very
e&#383;timable; he therefore &#383;tudies to di&#383;gui&#383;e the
coldne&#383;s of his heart by the exaggeration of his language, and
&#383;upplies, by an affected exce&#383;s of &#383;entiment, the
total ab&#383;ence of it.&mdash;The gods have not (as you know)
made me poetical, nor do I often tax your patience with a
&#383;imile, but I think this French &#383;en&#383;ibility is to
genuine feeling, what their pa&#383;te is to the diamond&mdash;it
gratifies the vanity of the wearer, and deceives the eye of the
&#383;uperficial ob&#383;erver, but is of little u&#383;e or value,
and when tried by the fire of adver&#383;ity quickly
di&#383;appears.</p>
<p>You are not much obliged to me for this long letter, as I own I
have &#383;cribbled rather for my own amu&#383;ement than with a
view to yours.&mdash; Contrary to our expectation, the trial of the
King has begun; and, though I cannot properly be &#383;aid to have
any real intere&#383;t in the affairs of this country, I take a
very &#383;incere one in the fate of its unfortunate
Monarch&mdash;indeed our whole hou&#383;e has worn an appearance of
dejection &#383;ince the commencement of the bu&#383;ine&#383;s.
Mo&#383;t people &#383;eem to expect it will terminate favourably,
and, I believe, there are few who do not wi&#383;h it. Even the
Convention &#383;eem at pre&#383;ent di&#383;po&#383;ed to be
merciful; and as they judge now, &#383;o may they be judged
hereafter!</p>

<h2>Amiens, January 1793.</h2>
<p>I do all po&#383;&#383;ible ju&#383;tice to the liberality of my
countrymen, who are become &#383;uch pa&#383;&#383;ionate admirers
of the French; and I cannot but lament their having been &#383;o
unfortunate in the choice of the aera from whence they date this
new friend&#383;hip. It is, however, a proof, that their regards
are not much the effect of that kind of vanity which
e&#383;teem&#383; objects in proportion as they are e&#383;teemed
by the re&#383;t of the world; and the &#383;incerity of an
attachment cannot be better evinced than by it&#383; &#383;urviving
irretrievable di&#383;grace and univer&#383;al abhorrence. Many
will &#383;well the triumph of a hero, or add a trophy to his tomb;
but he who exhibits him&#383;elf with a culprit at the gallows, or
decorates the gibbet with a wreath, is a friend indeed.</p>
<p>If ever the character of a people were repugnant to amity, or
inimical to connection, it is that of the French for the la&#383;t
three years.&mdash;*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The editor of the <i>Courier de l'Egalite,</i> a
mo&#383;t decided patriot, thus expre&#383;&#383;es him&#383;elf on
the injuries and in&#383;ults received by the King from the
Pari&#383;ians, and their municipality, previous to hi&#383; trial:
"I know that Louis is guilty&mdash;but are we to double his
puni&#383;hment before it is pronounced by the law? Indeed one is
tempted to &#383;ay that, in&#383;tead of being guided by the
humanity and philo&#383;ophy which dictated the revolution, we have
taken le&#383;&#383;ons of barbarity from the mo&#383;t ferocious
&#383;avage&#383;! Let us be virtuous if we would be republicans;
if we go on as we do, we never &#383;hall, and mu&#383;t have
recour&#383;e to a de&#383;pot: for of two evils it is better to
choo&#383;e the lea&#383;t."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The editor, who&#383;e opinion of the pre&#383;ent politics is
thus expre&#383;&#383;ed, i&#383; &#383;o truly a
revolutioni&#383;t, and &#383;o confidential a patriot, that, in
Augu&#383;t la&#383;t, when almo&#383;t all the journali&#383;ts
were murdered, his paper was the only one that, for &#383;ome time,
was allowed to reach the departments.</p>
<p>In this &#383;hort &#383;pace they have formed a compendium of
all the vices which have marked as many preceding ages:&mdash;the
cruelty and treachery of the league&mdash;the &#383;edition,
levity, and intrigue of the <i>Fronde</i> [A name given to the
party in oppo&#383;ition to the court during Cardinal
Mazarin'&#383; mini&#383;try.&mdash;See the origin of it in the
Memoirs of that period.] with the licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s and
political corruption of more modern epochs. Whether you examine the
conduct of the nation at large, or that of its chiefs and leaders,
your feelings revolt at the one, and your integrity
de&#383;pi&#383;es the other. You &#383;ee the idols erected by
Folly, degraded by Caprice;&mdash;the authority obtained by
Intrigue, bartered by Profligacy;&mdash;and the perfidy and
corruption of one &#383;ide &#383;o balanced by the barbarity and
levity of the other, that the mind, unable to decide on the
preference of contending vices, is obliged to find repo&#383;e,
though with regret and di&#383;gu&#383;t, in acknowledging the
general depravity.</p>
<p>La Fayette, without very extraordinary preten&#383;ions, became
the hero of the revolution. He dictated laws in the
A&#383;&#383;embly, and pre&#383;cribed oath&#383; to the Garde
Nationale&mdash;and, more than once, in&#383;ulted, by the triumph
of o&#383;tentatious popularity, the humiliation and
di&#383;tre&#383;s of a per&#383;ecuted Sovereign. Yet when La
Fayette made an effort to maintain the con&#383;titution to which
he owed his fame and influence, he was abandoned with the &#383;ame
levity with which he had been adopted, and &#383;unk, in an
in&#383;tant, from a dictator to a fugitive!</p>
<p>Neckar was an idol of another de&#383;cription. He had already
departed for his own country, when he was hurried back
precipitately, amid&#383;t univer&#383;al acclamations. All were
full of projects either of honour or recompence&mdash; one was for
decreeing him a &#383;tatue, another propo&#383;ed him a
pen&#383;ion, and a third hailed him the father of the country. But
Mr. Neckar knew the French character, and very wi&#383;ely declined
the&#383;e pompous offers; for before he could have received the
fir&#383;t quarter of his pen&#383;ion, or the &#383;tatue could
have been modelled, he was glad to e&#383;cape, probably not
without &#383;ome apprehen&#383;ions for his head!</p>
<p>The reign of Mirabeau was &#383;omething longer. He lived with
popularity, was fortunate enough to die before his reputation was
exhau&#383;ted, wa&#383; depo&#383;ited in the Pantheon,
apotheo&#383;i&#383;ed in form, and his bu&#383;t placed as a
companion to that of Brutus, the tutelary genius of the
A&#383;&#383;embly.&mdash;Here, one might have expected, he would
have been quit for this world at lea&#383;t; but the fame of a
patriot is not &#383;ecured by his death, nor can the god&#383; of
the French be called immortal: the deification of Mirabeau i&#383;
&#383;u&#383;pended, his memory put in &#383;eque&#383;tration, and
a committee appointed to enquire, whether a profligate,
expen&#383;ive, and nece&#383;&#383;itous character wa&#383; likely
to be corruptible. The Convention, too, &#383;eem highly indignant
that a man, remarkable only for vice and atrocity, &#383;hould make
no con&#383;cience of betraying tho&#383;e who were as bad as
him&#383;elf; and that, after having pro&#383;tituted his talents
from the moment he was con&#383;cious of them, he &#383;hould not,
when a&#383;&#383;ociated with &#383;uch immaculate colleagues,
become pure and di&#383;intere&#383;ted. It is very probable that
Mirabeau, who&#383;e only aim was power, might rather be willing to
&#383;hare it with the King, a&#383; Mini&#383;ter, than with
&#383;o many competitors, and only as Prime Speechmaker to the
A&#383;&#383;embly: and as he had no rea&#383;on for
&#383;u&#383;pecting the patrioti&#383;m of others to be more
inflexible than his own, he might think it not impolitic to
anticipate a little the common cour&#383;e of things, and betray
his companions, before they had time to &#383;tipulate for felling
him. He might, too, think him&#383;elf more ju&#383;tified in
di&#383;po&#383;ing of them in the gro&#383;s, becau&#383;e he did
not thereby deprive them of their right of bargaining for
them&#383;elves, and for each other in detail.&mdash;*</p>

I have neutralized him.&mdash;To-night we &#383;hall make a

difficult, for he will receive nothing. He in&#383;i&#383;ts,
previous to coming to any definitive treaty, on being named
Phy&#383;ician to the Army. I have promi&#383;ed him, on condition
that Paris is kept quiet for fifteen days. He is now gone to exert
him&#383;elf in our favour. He has great credit at the Caffe de

that it mu&#383;t be admitted, that either all the fir&#383;t

<p>The King might al&#383;o be &#383;olicitous to purcha&#383;e
&#383;afety and peace at any rate; and it is unfortunate for
him&#383;elf and the country that he had not recour&#383;e to the
only effectual means till it was too late. But all thi&#383;
re&#383;ts on no better evidence than the papers found at the
Thuilleries; and as &#383;omething of this kind was
nece&#383;&#383;ary to nouri&#383;h the exhau&#383;ted fury of the
populace, I can ea&#383;ily conceive that it was thought more
prudent to &#383;acrifice the dead, than the living; and the fame
of Mirabeau being le&#383;&#383; valuable than the &#383;afety of
tho&#383;e who &#383;urvived him, there would be no great harm in
attributing to him what he was very likely to have done.&mdash; The
corruption of a notorious courtier would have made no
impre&#383;&#383;ion: the King had already been overwhelmed with
&#383;uch accu&#383;ations, and they had lo&#383;t their effect:
but to have &#383;educed the virtuous Mirabeau, the very Confucius
of the revolution, was a kind of profanation of the holy fire, well
calculated to revive the languid rage, and extingui&#383;h the
&#383;mall remains of humanity yet left among the people.</p>
<p>It is &#383;ufficiently remarkable, that notwith&#383;tanding
the court mu&#383;t have &#383;een the nece&#383;&#383;ity of
gaining over the party now in power, no ve&#383;tige of any attempt
of this kind has been di&#383;covered; and every criminating
negotiation is a&#383;cribed to the dead, the ab&#383;ent, or the
in&#383;ignificant. I do not, however, pre&#383;ume to decide in a
ca&#383;e &#383;o very delicate; their panegyri&#383;ts in England
may adju&#383;t the claims of Mirabeau's integrity, and that of his
accu&#383;ers, at their lei&#383;ure.</p>
<p>Another patriot of "di&#383;tingui&#383;hed note," and more
peculiarly intere&#383;ting to our countrymen, becau&#383;e he has
laboured much for their conver&#383;ion, i&#383; Talleyrand,
Bi&#383;hop of Autun.&mdash;He was in England &#383;ome time
a&#383; Plenipotentiary from the Jacobins, charged with
e&#383;tabli&#383;hing treatie&#383; between the clubs,
publi&#383;hing &#383;editious manife&#383;toes, contracting
friendly alliances with di&#383;contented &#383;cribblers, and
gaining over neutral or ho&#383;tile new&#383;papers.&mdash;But,
be&#383;ides his political and eccle&#383;ia&#383;tical
occupations, and that of writing letters to the Con&#383;titutional
Society, it &#383;eems this indu&#383;trious Prelate had
likewi&#383;e a corre&#383;pondence with the Agents of the Court,
which, though he was too mode&#383;t to &#383;urcharge hi&#383;
fame by publi&#383;hing it, was, neverthele&#383;s, very
profitable.</p>
<p>I am &#383;orry his friends in England are mo&#383;tly
aver&#383;e from epi&#383;copacy, otherwi&#383;e they might have
provided for him, as I imagine he will have no objection to
relinqui&#383;h his claims on the &#383;ee of Autun. He is not
under accu&#383;ation, and, were he to return, he would not find
the laws quite &#383;o ceremonious here as in England. After
labouring with impunity for month&#383; together to promote an
in&#383;urrection with you, a &#383;mall private barter of his
talents would here co&#383;t him his head; and I appeal to the
Bi&#383;hop'&#383; friends in England, whether there can be a
proper degree of freedom in a country where a man is refu&#383;ed
the privilege of di&#383;po&#383;ing of him&#383;elf to the
be&#383;t advantage.</p>
<p>To the eternal obloquy of France, I mu&#383;t conclude, in the
li&#383;t of tho&#383;e once popular, the ci-devant Duke of
Orleans. But it was an unnatural popularity, unaided by a
&#383;ingle talent, or a &#383;ingle virtue, &#383;upported only by
the venal efforts of tho&#383;e who were almo&#383;t his equals in
vice, though not in wealth, and who found a grateful exerci&#383;e
for their abilities in at once profiting by the weak ambition of a
bad man, and corrupting the public morals in his favour. The
unrighteous compact i&#383; now di&#383;&#383;olved; tho&#383;e
whom he ruined him&#383;elf to bribe have already for&#383;aken
him, and perhaps may endeavour to palliate the di&#383;grace of
having been called his friends, by becoming his
per&#383;ecutors.&mdash;Thus, many of the primitive patriots are
dead, or fugitives, or abandoned, or treacherous; and I am not
without fear le&#383;t the new race &#383;hould prove a&#383;
evane&#383;cent as the old.</p>
<p>The virtuous Rolland,* who&#383;e fir&#383;t re&#383;ignation
was &#383;o in&#383;trumental in dethroning the King, has now been
obliged to re&#383;ign a &#383;econd time, charged with want of
capacity, and &#383;u&#383;pected of malver&#383;ation; and
thi&#383; virtue, which was &#383;o irreproachable, which it would
have been &#383;o dangerous to di&#383;pute while it &#383;erved
the purpo&#383;es of party, is become hypocri&#383;y, and Rolland
will be fortunate if he return to ob&#383;curity with only the
lo&#383;s of his gains and his reputation.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* In the beginning of December, the Council-General of
the municipality of Paris opened a regi&#383;ter, and appointed a
Committee to receive all accu&#383;ations and complaints whatever
again&#383;t Rolland, who, in return, &#383;ummoned them to deliver
in their accounts to him a&#383; Mini&#383;ter of the interior, and
accu&#383;ed them, at the &#383;ame time, of the mo&#383;t
&#383;candalous peculations.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The credit of Bri&#383;&#383;ot and the Philo&#383;ophers is
declining fa&#383;t&mdash;the club&#383; are unpropitious, and no
party long &#383;urvives this formidable omen; &#383;o that, like
Macbeth, they will have waded from one crime to another, only to
obtain a &#383;hort-lived dominion, at the expence of eternal
infamy, and an unlamented fall.</p>
<p>Dumouriez is &#383;till a &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful General, but
he is denounced by one faction, in&#383;ulted by another,
in&#383;idiou&#383;ly prai&#383;ed by a third, and, if he
&#383;hould per&#383;evere in &#383;erving them, he has more
di&#383;intere&#383;ted rectitude than I &#383;u&#383;pect him of,
or than they merit. This is another of that Jacobin mini&#383;try
which proved &#383;o fatal to the King; and it is evident that, had
he been permitted to entertain the &#383;ame opinion of all
the&#383;e people as they now profe&#383;s to have of each other,
he would have been &#383;till living, and &#383;ecure on his
throne.</p>
<p>After &#383;o many mutual infidelities, it might be expected
that one party would grow indifferent, and the other
&#383;u&#383;picious; but the French never de&#383;pair: new hordes
of patriots prepare to po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s them&#383;elves of
the places they are forcing the old ones to abandon, and the
people, eager for change, are ready to receive them with the
momentary and fallaciou&#383; enthu&#383;ia&#383;m which ever
precedes di&#383;grace; while tho&#383;e who are thu&#383;
intriguing for power and influence, are, perhaps, &#383;ecretly
devi&#383;ing how it may be made mo&#383;t &#383;ub&#383;ervient to
their per&#383;onal advantage.</p>
<p>Yet, perhaps, the&#383;e amiable levities may not be
di&#383;plea&#383;ing to the Con&#383;titutional Society and the
revolutioni&#383;ts of England; and, as the very faults of our
friends are often endearing to us, they may extend their indulgence
to the "humane" and "liberal" precepts of the Jacobins, and the
ma&#383;&#383;acres of September.&mdash;To confe&#383;s the truth,
I am not a little a&#383;hamed for my country when I &#383;ee
addre&#383;&#383;es from England to a Convention, the members of
which have ju&#383;t been accu&#383;ing each other of
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination and robbery, or, in the ardour of
a debate, threatening, cuffing, and knocking each other down.
Exclu&#383;ive of their moral character, con&#383;idered only as it
appears from their reciprocal criminations, they have &#383;o
little preten&#383;ion to dignity, or even decency, that it
&#383;eems a mockery to addre&#383;s them as the political
repre&#383;entatives of a powerful nation deliberating upon
important affairs.</p>
<p>If a bearer of one of the&#383;e congratulatory compliments were
not apprized of the forms of the Hou&#383;e, he would be rather
a&#383;toni&#383;hed, at hi&#383; introduction, to &#383;ee one
member in a menacing attitude, and another denying his veracity in
terms perfectly explicit, though not very civil. Perhaps, in two
minutes, the partizans of each opponent all ri&#383;e and clamour,
as if preparing for a combat&mdash;the Pre&#383;ident puts on his
hat a&#383; the &#383;ignal of a &#383;torm&mdash;the
&#383;ubordinate di&#383;putants are appea&#383;ed&mdash;and the
revilings of the principal ones renewed; till, after torrents of
indecent language, the quarrel is terminated by a fraternal
embrace.*&mdash;I think, after &#383;uch a &#383;cene, an
addre&#383;&#383;er mu&#383;t feel a little humiliated, and would
return without finding his pride greatly increa&#383;ed by his
mi&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I do not make any a&#383;&#383;ertions of this nature
from conjecture or partial evidence. The journals of the time
atte&#383;t that the &#383;cenes I de&#383;cribe occur almo&#383;t
in every debate.&mdash;As a proof, I &#383;ubjoin &#383;ome
extracts taken nearly at hazard: "January 7th, Convention
Nationale, Pre&#383;idence de Treilhard.&mdash;The debate was
opened by an addre&#383;s from the department of Fini&#383;terre,
expre&#383;&#383;ing their wi&#383;hes, and adding, that the&#383;e
were likewi&#383;e the wi&#383;hes of the nation at
large&mdash;that Marat, Robe&#383;pierre, Bazire, Chabot, Merlin,
Danton, and their accomplices, might be expelled the Convention as
caballers and intriguers paid by the tyrants at war with France."
The account of this debate is thus continued&mdash;"The almo&#383;t
daily troubles which ari&#383;e in the Convention were on the point
of being renewed, when a member, a friend to order, &#383;poke as
follows, and, it is remarked, was quietly li&#383;tened to:
"'Citizens, "'If three months of uninterrupted &#383;ilence has
given me any claim to your attention, I now a&#383;k it in the name
of our afflicted country. Were I to continue &#383;ilent any
longer, I &#383;hould render my&#383;elf a&#383; culpable as
tho&#383;e who never hold their tongues. I &#383;ee we are all
&#383;en&#383;ible of the painfulne&#383;s of our &#383;ituation.
Every day di&#383;&#383;ati&#383;fied with our&#383;elves, we come
to the debate with the intention of doing &#383;omething, and every
day we return without having done any thing. The people expect from
us wi&#383;e laws, and not &#383;torm&#383; and tumults. How are we
to make the&#383;e wi&#383;e laws, and keep twenty-five millions of
people quiet, when we, who are only &#383;even hundred and fifty
individuals, give an example of perpetual riot and di&#383;order?
What &#383;ignifies our preaching the unity and indivi&#383;ibility
of the republic, when we cannot maintain peace and union
among&#383;t our&#383;elves? What good can we expect to do
amid&#383;t &#383;uch &#383;candalou&#383; di&#383;turbances, and
while we &#383;pend our time in attending to informations,
accu&#383;ations, and inculpations, for the mo&#383;t part utterly
unfounded? For my part, I &#383;ee but one means of attaining any
thing like dignity and tranquillity, and that is, by
&#383;ubmitting our&#383;elves to coercive regulations.'" Here
follow &#383;ome propo&#383;als, tending to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a
little decency in their proceedings for the future; but the account
from whence thi&#383; extract is taken proceeds to remark, that
this invitation to peace was no &#383;ooner fini&#383;hed, than a
new &#383;cene of di&#383;turbance took place, to the great
lo&#383;s of their time, and the &#383;candal of all good citizens.
One &#383;hould imagine, that if ever the Convention could think it
nece&#383;&#383;ary to a&#383;&#383;ume an appearance of dignity,
or at lea&#383;t of &#383;eriou&#383;ne&#383;s and order, it would
be in giving their judgement relative to the King. Yet, in
determining how a &#383;eries of que&#383;tion&#383; &#383;hould be
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed, on the arrangement of which his fate
&#383;eems much to have depended, the &#383;olemnity of the
occa&#383;ion appears to have had no weight. It was propo&#383;ed
to begin by that of the appeal to the people. This was &#383;o
violently combated, that the Convention would hear neither party,
and were a long time without debating at all. Petion mounted the
tribune, and attempted to re&#383;tore order; but the noi&#383;e
was too great for him to be heard. He at length, however, obtained
&#383;ilence enough to make a motion. Again the murmur&#383;
recommenced. Rabaud de St. Etienne made another attempt, but
wa&#383; equally un&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful. Tho&#383;e that were
of an oppo&#383;ite opinion refu&#383;ed to hear him, and both
parties ro&#383;e up and ru&#383;hed together to the middle of the
Hall. The mo&#383;t dreadful tumult took place, and the
Pre&#383;ident, with great difficulty, procured a calm. Again the
&#383;torm began, and a member told them, that if they voted in the
affirmative, tho&#383;e on the left &#383;ide (Robe&#383;pierre,
&amp;c.) would not wait the re&#383;ult, but have the King
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inated. "Ye&#383;! Ye&#383;!
(re&#383;ounded from all parts) the Scelerats of Paris will murder
him!" &mdash;Another violent di&#383;order en&#383;uing, it was
thought no decree could be pa&#383;&#383;ed, and, at length,
amid&#383;t this &#383;cene of riot and confu&#383;ion, the order
of que&#383;tions was arranged, and in &#383;uch a manner as to
decide the fate of the King.&mdash;It was determined, that the
que&#383;tion of his guilt &#383;hould precede that of the appeal
to the people. Had the order of the que&#383;tions been changed,
the King might have been &#383;aved, for many would have voted for
the appeal in the fir&#383;t in&#383;tance who did not dare do it
when they found the majority re&#383;olved to pronounce him
guilty.</blockquote>

<p>It is very remarkable, that, on the &#383;ame day on which the
friends of liberty and equality of Manche&#383;ter &#383;ignalized
them&#383;elves by a mo&#383;t patriotic compliment to the
Convention, beginning with <i>"Francais, vou&#383; etes
libres,"</i> ["Frenchmen, you are free."] they were, at that very
moment, employed in di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing a petition from
numbers of Pari&#383;ians who had been thrown into pri&#383;on
without knowing either their crime or their accu&#383;ers, and were
&#383;till detained under the &#383;ame arbitrary
circum&#383;tances.&mdash;The law of the con&#383;titution is, that
every per&#383;on arre&#383;ted &#383;hall be interrogated within
twenty-four hours; but as the&#383;e impri&#383;onments were the
work of the republican Mini&#383;ters, the Convention &#383;eemed
to think it indelicate to interpo&#383;e, and the&#383;e citizens
of a country who&#383;e freedom is &#383;o much envied by the
Manche&#383;ter Society, will mo&#383;t likely remain in durance as
long as their confinement &#383;hall be convenient to tho&#383;e
who have placed them there.&mdash;A &#383;hort time after,
Villette, who is a news-writer and deputy, was cited to appear
before the municipality of Paris, under the charge of having
in&#383;erted in his paper "equivocal phra&#383;es and anti-civic
expre&#383;&#383;ions, tending to dimini&#383;h the confidence due
to the municipality."&mdash;Villette, as being a member of the
Convention, obtained redre&#383;s; but had he been only a
journali&#383;t, the liberty of the pre&#383;s would not have
re&#383;cued him.&mdash;On the &#383;ame day, complaint was made in
the A&#383;&#383;embly, that one man had been arre&#383;ted
in&#383;tead of another, and confined for &#383;ome weeks, and it
was agreed unanimou&#383;ly, (a thing that does not often occur,)
that the power&#383; exerci&#383;ed by the Committee of
In&#383;pection [Surveillance.&mdash;See Debates, December.] were
incompatible with liberty.</p>
<p>The patriots of Belfa&#383;t were not more fortunate in the
adaption of their civilitie&#383;&mdash;they addre&#383;&#383;ed
the Convention, in a &#383;train of great piety, to congratulate
them on the &#383;ucce&#383;s of their arms in the "cau&#383;e of
civil and religious liberty."*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* At this time the municipalities were empowered to
&#383;earch all hou&#383;es by night or day; but their vi&#383;ites
domiciliaires, as they are called, being made chiefly in the night,
a decree has &#383;ince ordained that they &#383;hall take place
only during the day. Perhaps an Engli&#383;hman may think the
latter quite &#383;ufficient, con&#383;idering that France is the

<p>The harangue was interrupted by the <i>mal-a-propo&#383;</i>
entrance of two deputies, who complained of having been beaten,
almo&#383;t hanged, and half drowned, by the people of Chartres,
for belonging, as they were told, to an a&#383;&#383;embly of
athei&#383;tical per&#383;ecutors of religion; and this Convention,
whom the Society of Belfa&#383;t admire for propagating "religious
liberty" in other countries, were in a few days humbly petitioned,
from variou&#383; departments, not to de&#383;troy it in their own.
I cannot, indeed, &#383;uppo&#383;e they have really &#383;uch a
de&#383;ign; but the contempt with which they treat religion has
occa&#383;ioned an alarm, and given the French an idea of their
piety very different from that &#383;o kindly conceived by the
patriots of Belfa&#383;t.</p>
<p>I entru&#383;t this to our friend Mrs. ____, who is leaving
France in a few days; and as we are now on the eve of a war, it
will be the la&#383;t letter you will receive, except a few lines
occa&#383;ionally on our private affairs, or to inform you of my
health. As we cannot, in the &#383;tate Mrs. D____ i&#383; in,
think of returning to England at pre&#383;ent, we mu&#383;t
tru&#383;t our&#383;elves to the ho&#383;pitality of the French for
at lea&#383;t a few weeks, and I certainly will not abu&#383;e it,
by &#383;ending any remarks on their political affairs out of the
country. But as I know you intere&#383;t your&#383;elf much in the
&#383;ubject, and read with partiality my attempts to amu&#383;e
you, I will continue to throw my ob&#383;ervations on paper as
regularly as I have been accu&#383;tomed to do, and I hope, ere
long, to be the bearer of the packets my&#383;elf. I here al&#383;o
renew my injunction, that no part of my corre&#383;pondence that
relate&#383; to French politics be communicated to any one, not
even my mother. What I have written has been merely to gratify your
own curio&#383;ity, and I &#383;hould be extremely mortified if my
opinions were repeated even in the little circle of our private
acquaintance. I deem my&#383;elf perfectly ju&#383;tifiable in
imparting my reflections to you, but I have a &#383;ort of delicacy
that revolts at the thought of being, in the remote&#383;t degree,
acce&#383;&#383;ary to conveying intelligence from a country in
which I re&#383;ide, and which is &#383;o peculiarly &#383;ituated
as France is at this moment. My feelings, my humanity, are
aver&#383;e from tho&#383;e who govern, but I &#383;hould regret to
be the means of injuring them. You cannot mi&#383;take my
intentions, and I conclude by &#383;eriou&#383;ly reminding you of
the promi&#383;e I exacted previous to any political
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h2>Amiens, February 15, 1793.</h2>
<p>I did not, as I promi&#383;ed, write immediately on my return
from Chantilly; the per&#383;on by whom I intended to &#383;end my
letter having already &#383;et out for England, and the rule I have
ob&#383;erved for the la&#383;t three months of entru&#383;ting
nothing to the po&#383;t but what relates to our family affairs, is
now more than ever nece&#383;&#383;ary. I have before
reque&#383;ted, and I mu&#383;t now in&#383;i&#383;t, that you make
no allu&#383;ion to any political matter whatever, nor even mention
the name of any political per&#383;on. Do not imagine that you are
qualified to judge of what is prudent, or what may be written with
&#383;afety&mdash;I repeat, no one in England can form an idea of
the &#383;u&#383;picion that pervades every part of the French
government.</p>
<p>I cannot venture to an&#383;wer deci&#383;ively your
que&#383;tion re&#383;pecting the King&mdash; indeed the
&#383;ubject is &#383;o painful to me, that I have hitherto avoided
reverting to it. There certainly was, as you ob&#383;erve,
&#383;ome &#383;udden alteration in the di&#383;po&#383;itions of
the A&#383;&#383;embly between the end of the trial and the final
judgement. The cau&#383;es were mo&#383;t probably various, and
mu&#383;t be &#383;ought for in the wor&#383;t vices of our
nature&mdash;cruelty, avarice, and cowardice. Many, I doubt not,
were guided only by the natural malignity of their hearts; many
acted from fear, and expected to purcha&#383;e impunity for former
compliances with the court by this popular expiation; a large
number are al&#383;o &#383;uppo&#383;ed to have been paid by the
Duke of Orlean&#383;&mdash;whether for the gratification of malice
or ambition, time mu&#383;t develope.&mdash;But, whatever were the
motives, the re&#383;ult was an iniquitous combination of the
wor&#383;t of a &#383;et of men, before &#383;elected from all that
was bad in the nation, to profane the name of ju&#383;tice&mdash;to
&#383;acrifice an unfortunate, but not a guilty Prince&mdash;and to
fix an indelible &#383;tain on the country.</p>
<p>Among tho&#383;e who gave their opinion at large, you will
ob&#383;erve Paine: and, as I intimated in a former letter, it
&#383;eems he was at that time rather allured by the vanity of
making a &#383;peech that &#383;hould be applauded, than by any
real de&#383;ire of injuring the King. Such vanity, however, is not
pardonable: a man has a right to ruin him&#383;elf, or to make
him&#383;elf ridiculous; but when his vanity becomes baneful to
others, as it has all the effect, &#383;o does it merit the
puni&#383;hment, of vice.</p>
<p>Of all the re&#383;t, Condorcet has mo&#383;t powerfully
di&#383;gu&#383;ted me. The avowed wickedne&#383;s of Thuriot or
Marat in&#383;pires one with horror; but this cold philo&#383;ophic
hypocrite excites contempt as well as dete&#383;tation. He
&#383;eem&#383; to have wavered between a de&#383;ire to
pre&#383;erve the reputation of humanity, which he has affected,
and that of gratifying the real depravity of hi&#383; mind. Would
one have expected, that a &#383;peech full of benevolent
&#383;y&#383;tems, mild &#383;entiments, and aver&#383;ion from the
effu&#383;ion of human blood, was to end in a vote for, and
recommendation of, the immediate execution of hi&#383;
&#383;overeign?&mdash;But &#383;uch a conduct is worthy of him, who
has repaid the benefits of his patron and friend [The Duke de la
Rochefaucault.] by a per&#383;ecution which ended in his
murder.</p>
<p>You will have &#383;een, that the King made &#383;ome trifling
reque&#383;ts to be granted after his decea&#383;e, and that the
Convention ordered him to be told, that the nation, "always great,
always ju&#383;t," accorded them in part. Yet this ju&#383;t and
magnanimous people refu&#383;ed him a preparation of only three
days, and allowed him but a few hour&#383;&mdash;&#383;uffered his
remains to be treated with the mo&#383;t &#383;candalous
indecency&mdash;and debated &#383;eriou&#383;ly, whether or no the
Queen &#383;hould receive &#383;ome little tokens of affection he
had left for her.</p>
<p>The King's enemies had &#383;o far &#383;ucceeded in
depreciating his per&#383;onal courage, that even his friends were
apprehen&#383;ive he might not &#383;u&#383;tain hi&#383; la&#383;t
moments with dignity. The event proves how much inju&#383;tice has
been done him in this re&#383;pect, as well as in many others. His
behaviour wa&#383; that of a man who derived his fortitude from
religion&mdash;it was that of pious re&#383;ignation, not
o&#383;tentatious courage; it was marked by none of tho&#383;e
in&#383;tances of levity and indifference which, at &#383;uch a
time, are rather &#383;ymptoms of di&#383;traction than
re&#383;olution; he exhibited the compo&#383;ure of an innocent
mind, and the &#383;eriou&#383;ne&#383;s that became the
occa&#383;ion; he &#383;eemed to be occupied in preparing for
death, but not to fear it.&mdash;I doubt not but the time will
come, when tho&#383;e who have &#383;acrificed him may envy the
la&#383;t moments of Louis the Sixteenth!</p>
<p>That the King was not guilty of the principal charges brought
again&#383;t him, has been proved indubitably&mdash;not altogether
by the a&#383;&#383;ertions of tho&#383;e who favour him, but by
the confe&#383;&#383;ion of his enemies. He was, for example,
accu&#383;ed of planning the in&#383;urrection of the tenth of
Augu&#383;t; yet not a day pa&#383;&#383;es that both parties in
the Convention are not di&#383;puting the priority of their efforts
to dethrone him, and to erect a republic; and they date their
machinations long before the period on which they attribute the
fir&#383;t aggre&#383;&#383;ion to the King.&mdash;Mr. Sourdat, and
&#383;everal other writers, have very ably demon&#383;trated the
fal&#383;ehood of the&#383;e charges; but the circulation of
&#383;uch pamphlets was dangerou&#383;&mdash;of cour&#383;e,
&#383;ecret and limited; while tho&#383;e which tended to deceive
and prejudice the people were di&#383;per&#383;ed with
profu&#383;ion, at the expence of the government.*</p>

<blockquote>* Po&#383;t&#383;cript of the Courier de l'Egalite,
Sept. 29: "The pre&#383;ent mini&#383;ter (Rolland) takes every
po&#383;&#383;ible means in hi&#383; power to enlighten and inform
the people in whatever concerns their real intere&#383;ts. For this
purpo&#383;e he has cau&#383;ed to be printed and di&#383;tributed,
in abundance, the accounts and papers relative to the events of the
tenth of Augu&#383;t. We have yet at our office a &#383;mall number
of the&#383;e publications, which we have di&#383;tributed to our
&#383;ub&#383;cribers, and we &#383;till give them to any of our
fellow-citizen&#383; who have opportunities of circulating
them."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I have &#383;een one of the&#383;e written in coar&#383;e
language, and replete with vulgar abu&#383;e, purpo&#383;ely
calculated for the lower cla&#383;&#383;es in the country, who are
more open to gro&#383;s impo&#383;itions than tho&#383;e of the
&#383;ame rank in towns; yet I have no doubt, in my own mind, that
all the&#383;e artifice&#383; would have proved unavailing, had the
deci&#383;ion been left to the nation at large: but they were
intimidated, if not convinced; and the mandate of the Convention,
which forbids this &#383;overeign people to exerci&#383;e their
judgement, was obeyed with as much &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion, and
perhaps more reluctance, than an edict of Louis the
fourteenth.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The King appealed, by his coun&#383;el, to the
People; but the convention, by a decree, declared his appeal of no
validity, and forbade all per&#383;ons to pay attention to it,
under the &#383;evere&#383;t penalties.</blockquote>

<p>The French &#383;eem to have no energy but to de&#383;troy, and
to re&#383;i&#383;t nothing but gentlene&#383;s or infancy. They
bend under a firm or oppre&#383;&#383;ive admini&#383;tration, but
become re&#383;tle&#383;s and turbulent under a mild Prince or a
minority.</p>
<p>The fate of this unfortunate Monarch has made me reflect, with
great &#383;eriou&#383;ne&#383;s, on the conduct of our
oppo&#383;ition-writers in England. The literary banditti who now
govern France began their operations by ridiculing the King's
private character&mdash;from ridicule they proceeded to calumny,
and from calumny to trea&#383;on; and perhaps the fir&#383;t libel
that degraded him in the eyes of his &#383;ubjects opened the path
from the palace to the &#383;caffold.&mdash;I do not mean to
attribute the &#383;ame perniciou&#383; intentions to the authors
on your &#383;ide the Channel, as I believe them, for the mo&#383;t
part, to be only mercenary, and that they would write panegyrics as
&#383;oon as &#383;atires, were they equally profitable. I know
too, that there is no danger of their producing revolutions in
England&mdash;we do not &#383;uffer our principles to be corrupted
by a man becau&#383;e he has the art of rhyming nothings into
con&#383;equence, nor &#383;uffer another to overturn the
government becau&#383;e he is an orator. Yet, though the&#383;e men
may not be very mi&#383;chievous, they are very reprehen&#383;ible;
and, in a moment like the pre&#383;ent, contempt and neglect
&#383;hould &#383;upply the place of that puni&#383;hment
again&#383;t which our liberty of the pre&#383;s &#383;ecures
them.</p>
<p>It is not for a per&#383;on no better informed than my&#383;elf
to pronounce on &#383;y&#383;tems of government&mdash;&#383;till
le&#383;s do I affect to have more enlarged notions than the
generality of mankind; but I may, without ri&#383;king tho&#383;e
imputations, venture to &#383;ay, I have no childi&#383;h or
irrational deference for the per&#383;ons of Kings. I know they are
not, by nature, better than other men, and a neglected or vicious
education may often render them wor&#383;e. This does not, however,
make me le&#383;s re&#383;pect the office. I re&#383;pect it as the
means cho&#383;en by the people to pre&#383;erve internal peace and
order&mdash;to bani&#383;h corruption and petty tyrants ["And fly
from petty tyrants to the throne."&mdash;Gold&#383;mith]&mdash;and
give vigour to the execution of the laws.</p>
<p>Regarded in this point of view, I cannot but lament the mode
which ha&#383; lately prevailed of endeavouring to alienate the
con&#383;ideration due to our King's public character, by
per&#383;onal ridicule. If an individual were attacked in this
manner, his hou&#383;e be&#383;et with &#383;pies, his
conver&#383;ation with his family li&#383;tened to, and the
mo&#383;t trifling actions of his life recorded, it would be deemed
unfair and illiberal, and he who &#383;hould practice &#383;uch
meanne&#383;s would be thought worthy of no puni&#383;hment more
re&#383;pectful than what might be inflicted by an oaken
cen&#383;or, or an admonitory heel.&mdash;But it will be &#383;aid,
a King is not an individual, and that &#383;uch a habit, or
&#383;uch an amu&#383;ement, is beneath the dignity of hi&#383;
character. Yet would it be but con&#383;i&#383;tent in tho&#383;e
who labour to prove, by the public acts of Kings, that they are
le&#383;s than men, not to exact, that, in their private lives,
they &#383;hould be more.&mdash;The great prototype of modern
&#383;atyri&#383;ts, Junius, does not allow that any credit
&#383;hould be given a Monarch for his dome&#383;tic virtues; is he
then to be reduced to an individual, only to &#383;crutinize his
foibles, and is his &#383;tation to &#383;erve only as the medium
of their publicity? Are the&#383;e literary miners to penetrate the
rece&#383;&#383;es of private life, only to bring to light the
dro&#383;s? Do they analy&#383;e only to di&#383;cover
poi&#383;ons? Such employments may be congenial to their natures,
but have little claim to public remuneration. The merit of a
detractor is not much &#383;uperior to that of a flatterer; nor is
a Prince more likely to be amended by imputed follies, than by
unde&#383;erved panegyrics. If any man wi&#383;hed to
repre&#383;ent his King advantageou&#383;ly, it could not be done
better than by remarking, that, after all the watchings of
a&#383;&#383;iduous nece&#383;&#383;ity, and the laboriou&#383;
re&#383;earches of intere&#383;ted curio&#383;ity, it appears, that
his private life affords no other &#383;ubjects of ridicule than,
that he is temperate, dome&#383;tic, and oeconomical, and, as is
natural to an active mind, wi&#383;he&#383; to be informed of
whatever happens not to be familiar to him. It were to be
de&#383;ired that &#383;ome of the&#383;e accu&#383;ations were
applicable to tho&#383;e who are &#383;o much &#383;candalized at
them: but they are not littlene&#383;&#383;e&#383;&mdash;the
littlene&#383;s is in him who conde&#383;cends to report them; and
I have often wondered that men of genius &#383;hould make a traffic
of gleaning from the refu&#383;e of anti-chambers, and retailing
the anecdotes of pages and footmen!</p>
<p>You will perceive the kind of publications I allude to; and I
hope the &#383;ituation of France, and the fate of its Monarch, may
&#383;ugge&#383;t to the authors a more worthy employ of their
talents, than that of degrading the executive power in the eyes of
the people.</p>

<h2>Amiens, Feb. 25, 1793.</h2>
<p>I told you, I believe, in a former letter, that the people of
Amiens were all ari&#383;tocrates: they have, neverthele&#383;s,
two extremely popular qualification&#383;&mdash;I mean filth and
incivility. I am, however, far from imputing either of them to the
revolution. This gro&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s of behavior has long
exi&#383;ted under the palliating de&#383;cription of <i>"la
franchi&#383;e Picarde,"</i> ["Picardy frankne&#383;s."] and the
floors and &#383;tairs of many hou&#383;es will atte&#383;t their
preeminence in filth to be of a date much anterior to the
revolution.&mdash;If you purcha&#383;e to the amount of an hundred
livres, there are many &#383;hopkeepers who will not &#383;end your
purcha&#383;es home; and if the articles they &#383;how you do not
an&#383;wer your purpo&#383;e, they are mo&#383;tly &#383;ullen,
and often rude. No appearance of fatigue or infirmity
&#383;ugge&#383;ts to them the idea of offering you a &#383;eat;
they contradict you with impertinence, addre&#383;s you with
freedom, and conclude with cheating you if they can. It was
certainly on this account that Sterne would not agree to die at the
inn at Amiens. He might, with equal ju&#383;tice, have objected to
any other hou&#383;e; and I am &#383;ure if he thought them an
unplea&#383;ant people to die among&#383;t, he would have found
them &#383;till wor&#383;e to live with.&mdash;My ob&#383;ervation
as to the civility of ari&#383;tocrates does not hold good
here&mdash;indeed I only meant that tho&#383;e who ever had any,
and were ari&#383;tocrates, &#383;till pre&#383;erved it.</p>
<p>Amiens has always been a commercial town, inhabited by very few
of the higher noble&#383;&#383;e; and the mere gentry of a French
province are not very much calculated to give a tone of
&#383;oftne&#383;s and re&#383;pect to tho&#383;e who imitate them.
You may, perhaps, be &#383;urprized that I &#383;hould
expre&#383;&#383; my&#383;elf with little con&#383;ideration for a
cla&#383;s which, in England, is &#383;o highly re&#383;pectable:
there gentlemen of merely independent circum&#383;tance&#383; are
not often di&#383;tingui&#383;hable in their manners from
tho&#383;e of &#383;uperior fortune or rank. But, in France, it is
different: the inferior noble&#383;&#383;e are &#383;tiff,
ceremonious, and o&#383;tentatious; while the higher ranks were
always polite to &#383;trangers, and affable to their dependents.
When you vi&#383;it &#383;ome of the former, you go through as many
ceremonies as though you were to be inve&#383;ted with an order,
and ri&#383;e up and &#383;it down &#383;o many times, that you
return more fatigued than you would from a cricket match; while
with the latter you are ju&#383;t as much at your ea&#383;e as is
con&#383;i&#383;tent with good breeding and propriety, and a whole
circle is never put in commotion at the entrance and exit of every
individual who makes part of it. Any one not prepared for
the&#383;e formalities, and who, for the fir&#383;t time, &#383;aw
an a&#383;&#383;embly of twenty people all ri&#383;ing from their
&#383;eats at the entrance of a &#383;ingle beau, would
&#383;uppo&#383;e they were preparing for a dance, and that the new
comer was a mu&#383;ician. For my part I always find it an oeconomy
of &#383;trength (when the locality makes it practicable) to take
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of a window, and continue
&#383;tanding in readine&#383;s until the hour of vi&#383;iting is
over, and calm is e&#383;tabli&#383;hed by the arrangement of the
card tables.&mdash;The revolution has not annihilated the
difference of rank; though it has effected the abolition of titles;
and I coun&#383;el all who have remains of the gout or inflexible
joints, not to frequent the hou&#383;e&#383; of ladies who&#383;e
hu&#383;bands have been ennobled only by their offices, of
tho&#383;e who&#383;e genealogies are modern, or of the collaterals
of ancient families, who&#383;e claims are &#383;o far removed as
to be doubtful. The &#383;ociety of all the&#383;e is very exigent,
and to be avoided by the infirm or indolent.</p>
<p>I &#383;end you with this a little collection of airs which I
think you will find very agreeable. The French mu&#383;ic has not,
perhaps, all the reputation it is entitled to. Rou&#383;&#383;eau
has declared it to be nothing but doleful p&#383;almodies; Gray
calls a French concert "Une tintamarre de diable:" and the
prejudices in&#383;pired by the&#383;e great names are not
ea&#383;ily obliterated. We &#383;ubmit our judgement to theirs,
even when our ta&#383;te i&#383; refractory.&mdash;The French
compo&#383;ers &#383;eem to excel in marches, in lively airs that
abound in &#383;triking pa&#383;&#383;ages calculated for the
popular ta&#383;te, and yet more particularly in tho&#383;e
&#383;imple melodies they call romances: they are often in a very
charming and &#383;ingular &#383;tyle, without being either &#383;o
delicate or affecting as the Italian. They have an
expre&#383;&#383;ion of plaintive tenderne&#383;s, which makes one
tranquil rather than melancholy; and which, though it be more
&#383;oothing than intere&#383;ting, is very
delightful.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have been to-day to take a la&#383;t view of the convents:
they are now adverti&#383;ed for &#383;ale, and will probably
&#383;oon be demoli&#383;hed. You know my opinion is not, on the
whole, favourable to the&#383;e in&#383;titutions, and that I
thought the decree which extingui&#383;hes them, but which
&#383;ecured to the religious already profe&#383;t the
undi&#383;turbed po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of their
habitation&#383; during life, was both politic and humane. Yet I
could not &#383;ee the pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of the&#383;e
buildings without pain&mdash;they are now inhabited by volunteers,
who are pa&#383;&#383;ing a novitiate of intemperance and
idlene&#383;s, previous to their reception in the army; and
tho&#383;e who recollect the peace and order that once reigned
within the walls of a mona&#383;tery, cannot but be &#383;tricken
with the contra&#383;t. I felt both for the expelled and
pre&#383;ent po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ors, and, perhaps, gave a
mental preference to the &#383;uper&#383;tition which founded
&#383;uch e&#383;tabli&#383;hments, over the per&#383;ecution that
de&#383;troys them.</p>
<p>The re&#383;igned and pious votaries, who once
&#383;uppo&#383;ed them&#383;elves &#383;ecure from all the
vici&#383;&#383;itudes of fortune, and who&#383;e union &#383;eemed
di&#383;&#383;oluble only by the common lot of mortality, are now
many of them di&#383;per&#383;ed, wandering, friendle&#383;s, and
mi&#383;erable. The religion which they cheri&#383;hed as a
comfort, and practi&#383;ed as a duty, is now pur&#383;ued as a
crime; and it is not yet certain that they will not have to
choo&#383;e between an abjuration of their principles, and the
relinqui&#383;hment of the means of exi&#383;tence.&mdash;The
military occupiers offered nothing very alleviating to &#383;uch
unplea&#383;ant reflections; and I beheld with as much regret the
collection of the&#383;e &#383;cattered individuals, as the
&#383;eparation of tho&#383;e who&#383;e habitations they fill.
They are mo&#383;t of them extremely young, taken from villages and
the &#383;ervice of agriculture, and are going to ri&#383;k their
lives in a cau&#383;e dete&#383;ted perhaps by more than three
parts of the nation, and only to &#383;ecure impunity to its
oppre&#383;&#383;ors.</p>
<p>It has u&#383;ually been a maxim in all civilized &#383;tates,
that when the general welfare nece&#383;&#383;itates &#383;ome act
of partial inju&#383;tice, it &#383;hall be done with the
utmo&#383;t con&#383;ideration for the &#383;ufferer, and that the
required &#383;acrifice of moral to political expediency &#383;hall
be palliated, as much as the circum&#383;tances will admit, by the
manner of carrying it into execution. But the French
legi&#383;lators, in this re&#383;pect, as in mo&#383;t others,
truly original, di&#383;dain all imitation, and are rarely guided
by &#383;uch confined motives. With them, private rights are
frequently violated, only to facilitate the means of public
oppre&#383;&#383;ion&#383;&mdash;and cruel and iniquitous decrees
are rendered &#383;till more &#383;o by the mode of enforcing
them.</p>
<p>I have met with no per&#383;on who could conceive the
nece&#383;&#383;ity of expelling the female religious from their
convents. It was, however, done, and that with a mixture of
meanne&#383;s and barbarity which at once excite&#383; contempt and
dete&#383;tation. The o&#383;ten&#383;ible, rea&#383;ons were, that
the&#383;e communities afforded an a&#383;ylum to the
&#383;uper&#383;titious, and that by their entire
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion, a &#383;ale of the hou&#383;es would
enable the nation to afford the religious a more liberal
&#383;upport than had been a&#383;&#383;igned them by the
Con&#383;tituent A&#383;&#383;embly. But they are &#383;hallow
politicians who expect to de&#383;troy &#383;uper&#383;tition by
per&#383;ecuting tho&#383;e who practi&#383;e it: and &#383;o far
from adding, as the decree in&#383;inuates, to the pen&#383;ions of
the nuns, they have now &#383;ubjected them to an oath which, to
tho&#383;e at lea&#383;t who&#383;e con&#383;ciences are timid,
will act as a prohibition to their receiving what they were before
entitled to.</p>
<p>The real intention of the legi&#383;lature in thus entirely
di&#383;per&#383;ing the female religious, be&#383;ides the general
hatred of every thing connected with religion, is, to
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s it&#383;elf of an additional re&#383;ource
in the buildings and effects, and, as is imagined by &#383;ome, to
procure numerou&#383; and convenient &#383;tate pri&#383;ons. But,
I believe, the latter is only an ari&#383;tocratic
apprehen&#383;ion, &#383;ugge&#383;ted by the appropriation of the
convent&#383; to this u&#383;e in a few places, where the ancient
pri&#383;ons are full.&mdash; Whatever purpo&#383;e it is intended
to an&#383;wer, it has been effected in a way di&#383;graceful to
any national body, except &#383;uch a body as the Convention; and,
though it be ea&#383;y to perceive the cruelty of &#383;uch a
mea&#383;ure, yet as, perhaps, its inju&#383;tice may not
&#383;trike you &#383;o forcibly as if you had had the &#383;ame
opportunities of inve&#383;tigating it as I have, I will endeavour
to explain, as well as I can, the circum&#383;tances that render it
&#383;o peculiarly aggravated.</p>
<p>I need not remind you, that no order is of very modern
foundation, nor that the pre&#383;ent century has, in a great
degree, exploded the fa&#383;hion of compounding for &#383;ins by
endowing religious in&#383;titutions. Thus, nece&#383;&#383;arily,
by the great change which has taken place in the expence of living,
many e&#383;tabli&#383;hments that were poorly endowed mu&#383;t
have become unable to &#383;upport them&#383;elves, but for the
efforts of tho&#383;e who were attached to them. It is true, that
the rent of land has increa&#383;ed as it&#383; produce became more
valuable; but every one knows that the land&#383; dependent on
religious hou&#383;es have always been let on &#383;uch moderate
terms, as by no means to bear a proportion to the
nece&#383;&#383;ities they were intended to &#383;upply; and as the
mona&#383;tic vows have long cea&#383;ed to be the frequent choice
of the rich, little increa&#383;e has been made to the original
&#383;tock by the acce&#383;&#383;ion of new votaries:&mdash;yet,
under all the&#383;e di&#383;advantages, many &#383;ocieties have
been able to rebuild their hou&#383;es, embelli&#383;h their
churches, purcha&#383;e plate, &amp;c. &amp;c. The love of their
order, that &#383;pirit of oeconomy for which they are remarkable,
and a per&#383;evering indu&#383;try, had their u&#383;ual effects,
and not only bani&#383;hed poverty, but became a &#383;ource of
wealth. An indefatigable labour at &#383;uch works as could be
profitably di&#383;po&#383;ed of, the education of children, and
the admi&#383;&#383;ion of boarders, were the means of enriching a
number of convents, who&#383;e proper revenues would not have
afforded them even a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence.</p>
<p>But the fruits of active toil or voluntary privation, have been
confounded with tho&#383;e of expiatory beque&#383;t and
mi&#383;taken devotion, and have alike become the prey of a
rapacious and unfeeling government. Many communities are driven
from habitations built ab&#383;olutely with the produce of their
own labour. In &#383;ome places they were refu&#383;ed even their
bed&#383; and linen; and the &#383;tock of wood, corn, &amp;c.
provided out of the &#383;aving&#383; of their pen&#383;ions,
(under&#383;tood to be at their own di&#383;po&#383;al,) have been
&#383;eized, and &#383;old, without making them the
&#383;malle&#383;t compen&#383;ation.</p>
<p>Thus deprived of every thing, they are &#383;ent into the world
with a prohibition either to live &#383;everal of them together,
wear their habits,* or practi&#383;e their religion; yet their
pen&#383;ion&#383;** are too &#383;mall for them to live upon,
except in &#383;ociety, or to pay the u&#383;ual expence of
boarding: many of them have no other means of procuring
&#383;ecular dre&#383;&#383;es, and &#383;till more will imagine
them&#383;elves criminal in ab&#383;taining from the mode of
wor&#383;hip they have been taught to think &#383;alutary.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Two religious, who boarded with a lady I had
occa&#383;ion to &#383;ee &#383;ometimes, told me, that they had
been &#383;trictly enjoined not to dre&#383;s like each other in
any way. ** The pen&#383;ions are from about &#383;eventeen to
twenty-five pound&#383; &#383;terling per annum.&mdash;At the time
I am writing, the nece&#383;&#383;aries of life are increa&#383;ed
in price nearly two-fifths of what they bore formerly, and are
daily becoming dearer. The Convention are not always
in&#383;en&#383;ible to thi&#383;&mdash;the pay of the foot
&#383;oldier is more than doubled.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It is al&#383;o to be remembered, that women of &#383;mall
fortune in France often embraced the mona&#383;tic life as a frugal
retirement, and, by &#383;inking the whole they were
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of in this way, they expected to
&#383;ecure a certain provi&#383;ion, and to place them&#383;elves
beyond the reach of future vici&#383;&#383;itudes: yet, though the
&#383;ums paid on the&#383;e occa&#383;ions can be ea&#383;ily
a&#383;certained, no indemnity has been made; and many will be
obliged to violate their principles, in order to receive a trifling
pen&#383;ion, perhap&#383; much le&#383;s than the intere&#383;t of
their money would have produced without lo&#383;s of the
principal.</p>
<p>But the views of the&#383;e legi&#383;lating philo&#383;ophers
are too &#383;ublimely exten&#383;ive to take in the wrongs or
&#383;ufferings of contemporary individuals; and not being able to
di&#383;gui&#383;e, even to them&#383;elves, that they create much
mi&#383;ery at pre&#383;ent, they promi&#383;e incalculable
advantage&#383; to tho&#383;e who &#383;hall happen to be alive
&#383;ome centuries hence! Mo&#383;t of the&#383;e poor nuns are,
however, of an age to preclude them from the hope of enjoying this
Millennium; and they would have been content en attendant
the&#383;e glorious times, not to be deprived of the
nece&#383;&#383;aries of life, or marked out as objects of
per&#383;ecution.</p>
<p>The private di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es occa&#383;ioned by the
di&#383;&#383;olution of the convents are not the only
con&#383;equences to be regretted&mdash;for a time, at lea&#383;t,
the lo&#383;&#383; mu&#383;t certainly be a public one. There will
now be no means of in&#383;truction for females, nor any refuge for
tho&#383;e who are without friend&#383; or relations:
thou&#383;ands of orphans mu&#383;t be thrown unprotected on the
world, and guardians, or &#383;ingle men, left with the care of
children, have no way to di&#383;po&#383;e of them properly. I do
not contend that the education of a convent is the be&#383;t
po&#383;&#383;ible: yet are there many advantage&#383; attending
it; and I believe it will readily be granted, that an education not
quite perfect is better than no education at all. It would not be
very difficult to prove, that the &#383;y&#383;tems of education,
both in England and France, are extremely defective; and if the
characters of women are generally better formed in one than the
other, it is not owing to the &#383;uperiority of
boarding-&#383;chools over convents, but to the difference of our
national manners, which tend to produce qualities not
nece&#383;&#383;ary, or not valued, in France.</p>
<p>The mo&#383;t di&#383;tingui&#383;hed female excellencies in
England are an attachment to dome&#383;tic life, an attention to
its oeconomies, and a cultivated under&#383;tanding. Here, any
thing like hou&#383;e-wifery is not expected but from the lower
cla&#383;&#383;es, and reading or information is confined chiefly
to profe&#383;&#383;ed wits. Yet the qualities &#383;o much
e&#383;teemed in England are not the effect of education: few
dome&#383;tic accompli&#383;hments, and little u&#383;eful
knowledge, are acquired at a boarding-&#383;chool; but finally the
national character a&#383;&#383;erts its empire, and the female who
has gone through a cour&#383;e of frivolities from &#383;ix to
&#383;ixteen, who has been taught that the fir&#383;t "human
principle" &#383;hould be to give an elegant tournure to her
per&#383;on, after a few year&#383;' di&#383;&#383;ipation, becomes
a good wife and mother, and a rational companion.</p>
<p>In France, young women are kept in great &#383;eclu&#383;ion:
religion and oeconomy form a principal part of conventual
acquirements, and the natural vanity of the &#383;ex is left to
develope it&#383;elf without the aid of authority, or
in&#383;tillation by precept&mdash;yet, when relea&#383;ed from
this &#383;ober tuition, manners take the a&#383;cendant here as in
England, and a woman commences at her marriage the aera of
coquetry, idlene&#383;s, freedom, and rouge.&mdash;We may
therefore, I think, venture to conclude, that the education of a
boarding-&#383;chool is better calculated for the rich, that of a
convent for the middle cla&#383;&#383;es and the poor; and,
con&#383;equently, that the &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion of this
la&#383;t in France will principally affect tho&#383;e to whom it
was mo&#383;t beneficial, and to whom the want of it will be
mo&#383;t dangerous.</p>
<p>A committee of wi&#383;e men are now forming a plan of public
in&#383;truction, which is to excel every thing ever adopted in any
age or country; and we may therefore hope that the defects which
have hitherto prevailed, both in theirs and our own, will be
remedied. All we have to apprehend is, that, amid&#383;t &#383;o
many wi&#383;e heads, more than one wi&#383;e plan may be produced,
and a difficulty of choice keep the ri&#383;ing generation in a
&#383;ort of abeyance, &#383;o that they mu&#383;t remain
&#383;terile, or may become vitiated, while it is determining in
what manner they &#383;hall be cultivated.</p>
<p>It is almo&#383;t a phra&#383;e to &#383;ay, the re&#383;ources
of France are wonderful, and this is no le&#383;s true than
generally admitted. Whatever be the want or lo&#383;s, it is no
&#383;ooner known than &#383;upplied, and the imagination of the
legi&#383;lature &#383;eems to become fertile in proportion to the
exigence of the moment.&mdash;I was in &#383;ome pain at the
di&#383;grace of Mirabeau, le&#383;t this new kind of
retro&#383;pective judgement &#383;hould depopulate the Pantheon of
the few divinities that remained; more e&#383;pecially when I
con&#383;idered that Voltaire, notwith&#383;tanding his merits as
an enemy to revelation, had been already accu&#383;ed of
ari&#383;tocracy, and even Rou&#383;&#383;eau him&#383;elf might
not be found impeccable. His Contrat Social might not, perhaps, in
the eyes of a committee of philo&#383;ophical Rhadmanthu&#383;'s,
atone for his occa&#383;ional admiration of chri&#383;tianity: and
thus &#383;ome crime, either of church or &#383;tate,
di&#383;franchi&#383;e the whole race of immortals, and their fame
&#383;carcely outla&#383;t the di&#383;pute about their earthly
remains.*</p>

and the per&#383;on who claimed the exclu&#383;ive right to the
remains of Rou&#383;&#383;eau.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>My concern, on this account, was the more ju&#383;tifiable,
becau&#383;e the great fallibility which prevailed among the
patriots, and the very delicate &#383;tate of the reputation of
tho&#383;e who retained their political exi&#383;tence, afforded no
hope that they could ever fill the vacancies in the
Pantheon.&mdash;But my fears were very
&#383;uperfluou&#383;&mdash;France will never want &#383;ubjects
for an apotheo&#383;is, and if one divinity be dethroned, "another
and another &#383;till &#383;ucceeds," all equally worthy as long
as they continue in fa&#383;hion.&mdash;The phrenzy of de&#383;pair
has &#383;upplied a &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;or to Mirabeau, in Le
Pelletier. [De St. Fargeau.] The latter had hitherto been little
heard of, but his death offered an occa&#383;ion for exciting the
people too favourable to be neglected: his patrioti&#383;m and his
virtues immediately increa&#383;ed in a ratio to the u&#383;e which
might be made of them;* a dying &#383;peech proper for the
purpo&#383;e was compo&#383;ed, and it was decreed
unanimou&#383;ly, that he &#383;hould be in&#383;talled in all the
rights, privileges, and immortalities of the degraded
Riquetti.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* At the fir&#383;t intelligence of his death, a member
of the Convention, who was with him, and had not yet had time to
&#383;tudy a &#383;peech, confe&#383;&#383;ed his la&#383;t words
to have been, "Jai froid."&mdash;"I am cold." This, however, would
nave made no figure on the banners of a funeral
proce&#383;&#383;ion; and Le Pelletier was made to die, like the
hero of a tragedy, uttering blank ver&#383;e.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The funeral that preceded the&#383;e divine awards was a farce,
which tended more to provoke a ma&#383;&#383;acre of the living,
than to honour the dead; and the Convention, who vowed to
&#383;acrifice their animo&#383;ities on his tomb, do &#383;o
little credit to the conciliating influence of St. Fargeau's
virtues, that they now di&#383;pute with more acrimony than
ever.</p>
<p>The departments, who begin to be extremely
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive to Paris, thought it incumbent on them to
imitate this ceremony; but as it was rather an act of fear than of
patrioti&#383;m, it was performed here with &#383;o much oeconomy,
and &#383;o little inclination, that the whole was cold and paltry.
&mdash;An altar was erected on the great market-place, and &#383;o
little were the people affected by the cata&#383;trophe of a
patriot whom they were informed had &#383;acrificed* his life in
their cau&#383;e, that the only part of the bu&#383;ine&#383;s
which &#383;eemed to intere&#383;t them was the extravagant
ge&#383;tures of a woman in a dirty white dre&#383;s, hired to act
the part of a "pleureu&#383;e," or mourner, and who&#383;e
&#383;orrow appeared to divert them infinitely.&mdash;</p>

Normandy. At the inn where he lodged, the extravagance of his
manner giving &#383;u&#383;picion&#383; that he was in&#383;ane,

entered his room while he was in bed, and intimated the
purpo&#383;e he was come for. PARIS affected to comply, and,
turning, drew a pi&#383;tol from under the clothes, and &#383;hot
him&#383;elf.&mdash;Among the papers found upon him were &#383;ome
affecting lines, expre&#383;&#383;ive of hi&#383; contempt for
life, and adding, that the influence of his example wa&#383; not to

a&#383;&#383;emble may be obeyed, but "that which pa&#383;&#383;eth
&#383;how" is not to be enforced. It is a limit pre&#383;cribed by
Nature her&#383;elf to authority, and &#383;uch is the
aver&#383;ion of the human mind from dictature and re&#383;traint,
that here an official rejoicing is often more &#383;erious than
the&#383;e political exactions of regret levied in favour of the
dead.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<h2>March 23, 1793.</h2>
<p>The partizans of the French in England alledge, that the
revolution, by giving them a government founded on principles of
moderation and rectitude, will be advantageous to all Europe, and
more e&#383;pecially to Great Britain, which has &#383;o often
&#383;uffered by wars, the fruit of their intrigues.&mdash;This
rea&#383;oning would be unan&#383;werable could the character of
the people be changed with the form of their government: but, I
believe, whoever examines its admini&#383;tration, whether as it
relates to foreign powers or internal policy, will find that the
&#383;ame &#383;pirit of intrigue, fraud, deception, and want of
faith, which dictated in the cabinet of Mazarine or Louvois, has
been tran&#383;fu&#383;ed, with the addition of meanne&#383;&#383;
and ignorance,* into a Con&#383;titutional Mini&#383;try, or the
Republican Executive Council.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The Executive Council is compo&#383;ed of men who, if
ever they were well-intentioned, mu&#383;t be totally unfit for the
government of an exten&#383;ive republic. Monge, the Mini&#383;ter
of the Marine, is a profe&#383;&#383;or of geometry; Garat,
Mini&#383;ter of Ju&#383;tice, a gazette writer; Le Brun,
Mini&#383;ter of Foreign Affairs, ditto; and Pache, Mini&#383;ter
of the Interior, a private tutor.&mdash;Whoever reads the debates
of the Convention will find few indications of real talents, and
much pedantry and ignorance. For example, Anachar&#383;is Cloots,
who is a member of the Committee of Public In&#383;truction, and
who one &#383;hould, of cour&#383;e, expect not to be more ignorant
than his colleagues, ha&#383; lately advi&#383;ed them to
di&#383;tre&#383;s the enemy by invading Scotland, which he calls
the granary of England.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>France had not yet determined on the articles of her future
political creed, when agents were di&#383;patched to make
pro&#383;elytes in England, and, in proportion as &#383;he
a&#383;&#383;umed a more popular form of government, all the
qualities which have ever marked her as the di&#383;turber of
mankind &#383;eem to have acquired new force. Every where the
amba&#383;&#383;adors of the republic are accu&#383;ed of attempts
to excite revolt and di&#383;content, and England* is now forced
into a war becau&#383;e &#383;he could not be per&#383;uaded to an
in&#383;urrection.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* For &#383;ome time previous to the war, all the
French prints and even members of the Convention, in their debates,
announced England to be on the point of an in&#383;urrection. The
intrigues of Chauvelin, their amba&#383;&#383;ador, to verify this
prediction, are well known. Bri&#383;&#383;ot, Le Brun, &amp;c. who
have &#383;ince been executed, were particularly charged by the
adver&#383;e party with provoking the war with England.
Robe&#383;pierre, and tho&#383;e who &#383;ucceeded, were not
&#383;o de&#383;irous of involving us in a foreign war, and their
humane efforts were directed merely to excite a civil
one.&mdash;The third article of accu&#383;ation again&#383;t
Rolland is, having &#383;ent twelve millions of livres to England,
to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t in procuring a declaration of
war.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it may be &#383;aid, that the French have taken this
part only for their own &#383;ecurity, and to procure adherents to
the common cau&#383;e; but this is all I contend for&mdash;that the
politics of the old government actuate the new, and that they have
not, in aboli&#383;hing courts and royalty, aboli&#383;hed the
perfidious &#383;y&#383;tem of endeavouring to benefit
them&#383;elves, by creating di&#383;tre&#383;s and
di&#383;&#383;ention among their neighbours.&mdash; Louvois
&#383;upplied the Prote&#383;tants in the Low Countries with money,
while he per&#383;ecuted them in France. The agents of the
republic, more oeconomical, yet directed by the &#383;ame motives,
eke out corruption by precepts of &#383;edition, and arm the
leaders of revolt with the rights of man; but, forgetting the maxim
that charity &#383;hould begin at home, in their zeal for the
freedom of other countries, they leave no portion of it for their
own!</p>
<p>Louis the Fourteenth over-ran Holland and the Palatinate to
plant the white flag, and lay the inhabitants under
contribution&mdash;the republic &#383;end an army to plant the tree
of liberty, levy a <i>don patriotique,</i> [Patriotic gift.] and
place garri&#383;ons in the towns, in order to pre&#383;erve their
freedom.&mdash;Kings have violated treaties from the de&#383;ire of
conque&#383;t &mdash;the&#383;e virtuous republicans do it from the
de&#383;ire of plunder; and, previous to opening the Scheldt, the
inva&#383;ion of Holland, was propo&#383;ed a&#383; a means of
paying the expences of the war. I have never heard that even the
mo&#383;t ambitious Potentates ever pretended to extend their
&#383;ubjugation beyond the per&#383;ons and property of the
conquered; but the&#383;e militant dogmati&#383;ts claim an empire
even over opinions, and in&#383;i&#383;t that no people can be free
or happy unle&#383;s they regulate their ideas of freedom and
happine&#383;s by the variable &#383;tandard of the Jacobin club.
Far from being of Hudibra&#383;'s philo&#383;ophy,* they &#383;eem
to think the mind as tangible as the body, and that, with the
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of an army, they may as &#383;oon lay one
"by the heel&#383;" as the other.</p>

<p>Now this I conceive to be the wor&#383;t of all tyrannies, nor
have I &#383;een it exceeded on the French theatre, though, within
the la&#383;t year, the imagination of their poets has been
peculiarly ingenious and inventive on this &#383;ubject.&mdash;It
is ab&#383;urd to &#383;uppo&#383;e this vain and overbearing
di&#383;po&#383;ition will cea&#383;e when the French government is
&#383;ettled. The intrigues of the popular party began in England
the very moment they attained power, and long before there was any
rea&#383;on to &#383;u&#383;pect that the Engli&#383;h would
deviate from their plan of neutrality. If, then, the French cannot
re&#383;train this mi&#383;chievous &#383;pirit while their own
affair&#383; are &#383;ufficient to occupy their utmo&#383;t
attention, it is natural to conclude, that, &#383;hould they once
become e&#383;tabli&#383;hed, lei&#383;ure and peace will make them
dangerous to the tranquillity of all Europe. Other governments may
be improved by time, but republics always degenerate; and if that
which is in its original &#383;tate of perfection exhibit already
the maturity of vice, one cannot, without being more credulous than
rea&#383;onable, hope any thing better for the future than what we
have experienced from the pa&#383;t.&mdash;It is, indeed,
unnece&#383;&#383;ary to detain you longer on this &#383;ubject.
You mu&#383;t, ere now, be perfectly convinced how far the
revolutionary &#383;y&#383;tems of France are favourable to the
peace and happine&#383;s of other countries. I will only add a few
details which may a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t you in judging of what
advantage they have been to the French them&#383;elves, and
whether, in changing the form of their government, they have
amended its principles; or if, in "conquering liberty," (as they
expre&#383;s it,) they have really become free.</p>
<p>The &#383;ituation of France has altered much within the
la&#383;t two months: the &#383;eat of power is le&#383;s
fluctuating and the exerci&#383;e of it more ab&#383;olute&mdash;
arbitrary mea&#383;ures are no longer incidental, but
&#383;y&#383;tematic&mdash;and a regular connection of dependent
tyranny is e&#383;tabli&#383;hed, beginning with the Jacobin clubs,
and ending with the committees of the &#383;ections. A &#383;imple
decree for in&#383;tance, has put all the men in the republic,
(unmarried and without children,) from eighteen to forty-five at
the requi&#383;ition of the Mini&#383;ter of War. A levy of three
hundred thou&#383;and i&#383; to take place immediately: each
department is re&#383;pon&#383;ible for the whole of a certain
number to the Convention, the di&#383;tricts are an&#383;werable
for their quota to the departments, the municipalities to the
di&#383;trict, and the diligence of the whole is animated by
itinerant members of the legi&#383;lature, entru&#383;ted with the
di&#383;po&#383;al of an armed force. The latter circum&#383;tance
may &#383;eem to you incredible; yet is it neverthele&#383;s true,
that mo&#383;t of the departments are under the juri&#383;diction
of the&#383;e &#383;overeigns, who&#383;e authority is nearly
unlimited. We have, at thi&#383; moment, two Deputies in the town,
who arre&#383;t and impri&#383;on at their plea&#383;ure.
One-and-twenty inhabitants of Amiens were &#383;eized a few
night&#383; ago, without any &#383;pecific charge having been
exhibited again&#383;t them, and are &#383;till in confinement. The
gates of the town are &#383;hut, and no one i&#383; permitted to
pa&#383;s or repa&#383;s without an order from the municipality;
and the ob&#383;ervance of this is exacted even of tho&#383;e who
re&#383;ide in the &#383;uburbs. Farmers and country people, who
are on hor&#383;eback, are obliged to have the features and
complexion of their hor&#383;es minuted on the pa&#383;&#383;port
with their own. Every per&#383;on whom it is found convenient to
call &#383;u&#383;picious, is deprived of his arms; and private
hou&#383;es are di&#383;turbed during the night, (in
oppo&#383;ition to a po&#383;itive law,) under pretext of
&#383;earching for refractory prie&#383;ts.&mdash;The&#383;e
regulations are not peculiar to this department, and you mu&#383;t
under&#383;tand them as conveying a general idea of what
pa&#383;&#383;es in every part of France.&mdash;I have yet to add,
that letters are opened with impunity&mdash;that immen&#383;e
&#383;ums of a&#383;&#383;ignats are created at the will of the
Convention&mdash;that no one is excu&#383;ed mounting guard in
per&#383;on&mdash;and that all hou&#383;ekeepers, and even lodgers,
are burthened with the quartering of troops, &#383;ometimes as many
as eight or ten, for weeks together.</p>
<p>You may now, I think, form a tolerable idea of the liberty that
ha&#383; accrued to the French from the revolution, the
dethronement of the King, and the e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of a
republic. But, though the French &#383;uffer thi&#383;
de&#383;poti&#383;m without daring to murmur openly, many a
&#383;ignificant &#383;hrug and doleful whi&#383;per pa&#383;s in
&#383;ecret, and this political di&#383;content has even its
appropriate language, which, though not very explicit, is perfectly
under&#383;tood.&mdash;Thus when you hear one man &#383;ay to
another, <i>"Ah, mon Dieu, on e&#383;t bien malheureux dans ce
moment ici;"</i> or, <i>"Nous &#383;ommes dans une po&#383;ition
tres critique&mdash;Je voudrois bien voir la fin de tout cela;"</i>
["God knows, we are very mi&#383;erable at pre&#383;ent&mdash;we
are in a very critical &#383;ituation&mdash;I &#383;hould like to
&#383;ee an end of all this."] you may be &#383;ure he
langui&#383;hes for the re&#383;toration of the monarchy, and hopes
with equal fervor, that he may live to &#383;ee the Convention
hanged. In the&#383;e &#383;ort of conferences, however, evaporates
all their courage. They own their country is undone, that they are
governed by a &#383;et of brigands, go home and hide any &#383;et
of valuables they have not already &#383;ecreted, and receive with
ob&#383;equious complai&#383;ance the next vi&#383;ite
domiciliaire.</p>
<p>The ma&#383;s of the people, with as little energy, have more
ob&#383;tinacy, and are, of cour&#383;e, not quite &#383;o
tractable. But, though they grumble and procra&#383;tinate, they do
not re&#383;i&#383;t; and their delays and demurs u&#383;ually
terminate in implicit &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>The Deputy-commi&#383;&#383;ioners, whom I have mentioned above,
have been at Amiens &#383;ome time, in order to promote the levying
of recruits. On Sundays and holidays they &#383;ummoned the
inhabitants to attend at the cathedral, where they harangued them
on the &#383;ubject, called for vengeance on the coale&#383;ced
de&#383;pots, expatiated on the love of glory, and
in&#383;i&#383;ted on the plea&#383;ure of dying for one's country:
while the people li&#383;tened with vacant attention, amu&#383;ed
them&#383;elves with the paintings, or adjourned in &#383;mall
committees to di&#383;cu&#383;s the hard&#383;hip of being obliged
to fight without inclination.&mdash;Thus time elap&#383;ed, the
military orations produced no effect, and no troops were
rai&#383;ed: no one would enli&#383;t voluntarily, and all
refu&#383;ed to &#383;ettle it by lot, becau&#383;e, as they
wi&#383;ely ob&#383;erved, the lot mu&#383;t fall on &#383;omebody.
Yet, notwith&#383;tanding the objection, the matter was at length
decided by this la&#383;t method. The deci&#383;ion had no
&#383;ooner taken place, than another difficulty
en&#383;ued&mdash;tho&#383;e who e&#383;caped acknowledged it was
the be&#383;t way that could be devi&#383;ed; but tho&#383;e who
were de&#383;tined to the frontiers refu&#383;ed to go. Various
altercations, and excu&#383;es, and references, were the
con&#383;equence; yet, after all thi&#383; murmuring and
eva&#383;ion, the pre&#383;ence of the Commi&#383;&#383;ioners and
a few dragoons have arranged the bu&#383;ine&#383;s very
pacifically; many are already gone, and the re&#383;t will (if the
dragoons continue here) &#383;oon follow.</p>
<p>This, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, is a ju&#383;t &#383;tatement of
the account between the Convention and the People: every thing is
effected by fear&mdash;nothing by attachment; and the one is obeyed
only becau&#383;e the other want courage to
re&#383;i&#383;t.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Rouen, March 31, 1793.</h2>
<p>Rouen, like mo&#383;t of the great towns in France, is what is
called decidedly ari&#383;tocratic; that is, the rich are
di&#383;contented becau&#383;e they are without &#383;ecurity, and
the poor becau&#383;e they want bread. But the&#383;e complaints
are not peculiar to large places; the cau&#383;es of them equally
exi&#383;t in the &#383;malle&#383;t village, and the only
difference which fixes the imputation of ari&#383;tocracy on one
more than the other, is, daring to murmur, or &#383;ubmitting in
&#383;ilence.</p>
<p>I mu&#383;t here remark to you, that the term ari&#383;tocrate
has much varied from its former &#383;ignification. A year ago,
ari&#383;tocrate implied one who was an advocate for the privileges
of the nobility, and a partizan of the ancient government&mdash;at
pre&#383;ent a man is an ari&#383;tocrate for entertaining exactly
the &#383;ame principles which at that time con&#383;tituted a
patriot; and, I believe, the computation is moderate, when I
&#383;ay, that more than three parts of the nation are
ari&#383;tocrates. The rich, who apprehend a violation of their
property, are ari&#383;tocrate&#383;&mdash;the merchants, who
regret the &#383;tagnation of commerce, and di&#383;tru&#383;t the
credit of the a&#383;&#383;ignats, are
ari&#383;tocrate&#383;&mdash;the &#383;mall retailers, who are
pillaged for not &#383;elling cheaper than they buy, and who find
the&#383;e outrages rather encouraged than repre&#383;&#383;ed, are
ari&#383;tocrate&#383;&mdash;and even the poor, who murmur at the
price of bread, and the numerous levies for the army, are,
occa&#383;ionally, ari&#383;tocrates.</p>
<p>Be&#383;ides all the&#383;e, there are likewi&#383;e various
cla&#383;&#383;es of moral ari&#383;tocrate&#383;&mdash;&#383;uch
as the humane, who are aver&#383;e from ma&#383;&#383;acres and
oppre&#383;&#383;ion&mdash;tho&#383;e who regret the lo&#383;s of
civil liberty&mdash;the devout, who tremble at the contempt for
religion&mdash;the vain, who are mortified at the national
degradation&mdash;and authors, who &#383;igh for the freedom of the
pre&#383;s.&mdash;When you con&#383;ider this multiplicity of
&#383;ymptomatic indications, you will not be &#383;urprized that
&#383;uch numbers are pronounced in a &#383;tate of
di&#383;ea&#383;e; but our republican phy&#383;icians will
&#383;oon generalize the&#383;e variou&#383; &#383;pecies of
ari&#383;tocracy under the &#383;ingle de&#383;cription of all who
have any thing to lo&#383;e, and every one will be deemed plethoric
who is not in a con&#383;umption. The people them&#383;elves who
ob&#383;erve, though they do not rea&#383;on, begin to have an idea
that property expo&#383;es the &#383;afety of the owner and that
the legi&#383;lature is le&#383;s inexorable when guilt i&#383;
unproductive, than when the conviction of a criminal comprehends
the forfeiture of an e&#383;tate.&mdash;A poor trade&#383;man was
lamenting to me ye&#383;terday, that he had neglected an offer of
going to live in England; and when I told him I thought he was very
fortunate in having done &#383;o, as he would have been declared an
emigrant, he replied, laughing, <i>"Moi emigre qui n'ai pas un
&#383;ol:"</i> ["I am emigrant, who am not worth a
halfpenny!"]&mdash;No, no; they don't make emigrants of tho&#383;e
who are worth nothing. And thi&#383; was not &#383;aid with any
intended irreverence to the Convention, but with the
&#383;implicity which really conceived the wealth of the emigrants
to be the cau&#383;e of the &#383;everity exerci&#383;ed
again&#383;t them.</p>
<p>The commercial and political evils attending a va&#383;t
circulation of a&#383;&#383;ignats have been often
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed, but I have never yet known the matter
con&#383;idered in what is, perhaps, its mo&#383;t &#383;erious
point of view&mdash;I mean its influence on the habits and morals
of the people. Wherever I go, e&#383;pecially in large towns like
this, the mi&#383;chief is evident, and, I fear, irremediable. That
oeconomy, which was one of the mo&#383;t valuable
characteri&#383;tics of the French, is now comparatively
di&#383;regarded. The people who receive what they earn in a
currency they hold in contempt, are more anxious to &#383;pend than
to &#383;ave; and tho&#383;e who formerly hoarded &#383;ix liards
or twelve &#383;ols pieces with great care, would think it folly to
hoard an a&#383;&#383;ignat, whatever its nominal value. Hence the
lower cla&#383;s of females di&#383;&#383;ipate their wages on
u&#383;ele&#383;s finery; men frequent public-hou&#383;es, and game
for larger &#383;ums than before; little &#383;hopkeepers,
in&#383;tead of ama&#383;&#383;ing their profits, become more
luxurious in their table: public places are always full; and
tho&#383;e who u&#383;ed, in a dre&#383;s becoming their
&#383;tation, to occupy the "parquet" or "parterre," now, decorated
with pa&#383;te, pins, gauze, and galloon, fill the
boxes:&mdash;and all thi&#383; de&#383;tructive prodigality is
excu&#383;ed to others and them&#383;elves <i>"par ce que ce
n'e&#383;t que du papier."</i> [Becau&#383;e it is only
paper.]&mdash;It is vain to per&#383;uade them to oeconomize what
they think a few weeks may render valuele&#383;s; and &#383;uch is
the evil of a circulation &#383;o totally di&#383;credited, that
profu&#383;ion a&#383;&#383;umes the merit of precaution,
extravagance the plea of nece&#383;&#383;ity, and tho&#383;e who
were not lavi&#383;h by habit become &#383;o through their
eagerne&#383;s to part with their paper. The buried gold and
&#383;ilver will again be brought forth, and the merchant and the
politician forget the mi&#383;chief of the a&#383;&#383;ignats. But
what can compen&#383;ate for the injury done to the people? What is
to re&#383;tore their ancient frugality, or bani&#383;h their
acquired wants? It is not to be expected that the return of
&#383;pecie will dimini&#383;h the inclination for luxury, or that
the human mind can be regulated by the national finance; on the
contrary, it i&#383; rather to be feared, that habits of expence
which owe their introduction to the paper will remain when the
paper is annihilated; that, though money may become more
&#383;carce, the propen&#383;ities of which it &#383;upplies the
indulgence will not be le&#383;s forcible, and that tho&#383;e who
have no other re&#383;ources for their accu&#383;tomed
gratifications will but too often find one in the &#383;acrifice of
their integrity.&mdash;Thus, the corruption of manners will be
&#383;ucceeded by the corruption of morals, and the
di&#383;hone&#383;ty of one &#383;ex, with the
licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s of the other, produce con&#383;equences
much wor&#383;e than any imagined by the ab&#383;tracted
calculation&#383; of the politician, or the &#383;elfi&#383;h ones
of the merchant. Age will be often without &#383;olace,
&#383;ickne&#383;s without alleviation, and infancy without
&#383;upport; becau&#383;e &#383;ome would not ama&#383;s for
them&#383;elves, nor others for their children, the profits of
their labour in a repre&#383;entative &#383;ign of uncertain
value.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to a&#383;&#383;ert that the&#383;e are the
natural effects of a paper circulation&mdash;doubtle&#383;s, when
&#383;upported by high credit, and an exten&#383;ive commerce, it
mu&#383;t have many advantages; but this was not the ca&#383;e in
France&mdash;the mea&#383;ure was adopted in a moment of
revolution, and when the credit of the country, never very
con&#383;iderable, was precarious and degraded&mdash;It did not
flow from the exuberance of commerce, but the artifices of
party&mdash;it never pre&#383;umed, for a moment, on the confidence
of the people&mdash;its reception was forced, and its
emi&#383;&#383;ion too profu&#383;e not to be alarming.&mdash;I
know it may be an&#383;wered, that the a&#383;&#383;ignats do not
depend upon an imaginary appreciation, but really repre&#383;ent a
large ma&#383;s of national wealth, particularly in the domains of
the clergy: yet, perhaps, it is this very circum&#383;tance which
has tended mo&#383;t to di&#383;credit them. Had their credit
re&#383;ted only on the &#383;olvency of the nation, though they
had not been greatly coveted, &#383;till they would have been
le&#383;&#383; di&#383;tributed; people would not have apprehended
their abolition on a change of government, nor that the
&#383;y&#383;tems adopted by one party might be rever&#383;ed by
another. Indeed we may add, that an experiment of this kind does
not begin au&#383;piciou&#383;ly when grounded on confi&#383;cation
and &#383;eizures, which it is probable more than half the French
con&#383;idered as &#383;acrilege and robbery; nor could they be
very anxious to po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s a &#383;pecies of wealth
which they made it a motive of con&#383;cience to hope would never
be of any value.&mdash;But if the original creation of
a&#383;&#383;ignats were objectionable, the &#383;ub&#383;equent
creations cannot but augment the evil. I have already
de&#383;cribed to you the effects vi&#383;ible at pre&#383;ent, and
tho&#383;e to be apprehended in future&mdash;others may re&#383;ult
from the new inundation, [1200 million&#383;&mdash;50 millions
&#383;terling.] which it is not po&#383;&#383;ible to conjecture;
but if the mi&#383;chiefs &#383;hould be real, in proportion as a
part of the wealth which this paper is &#383;aid to repre&#383;ent
is imaginary, their extent cannot ea&#383;ily be exaggerated.
Perhaps you will be of thi&#383; opinion, when you recollect that
one of the funds which form the &#383;ecurity of this va&#383;t
&#383;um is the gratitude of the Flemings for their liberty; and if
this reimbur&#383;ement be to be made according to the
&#383;pecimen the French army have experienced in their retreat, I
doubt much of the convention will be di&#383;po&#383;ed to advance
any farther claims on it; for, it &#383;eems, the inhabitants of
the Low Countries have been &#383;o little &#383;en&#383;ible of
the benefits be&#383;towed on them, that even the pea&#383;ants
&#383;eize on any weapon&#383; neare&#383;t hand, and drub and
pur&#383;ue the retrograding armies as they would wild bea&#383;ts;
and though, as Dumouriez ob&#383;erves in one of his
di&#383;patches, our revolution is intended to favour the country
people, <i>"c'e&#383;t cependant les gens de campagne qui
&#383;'arment contre nous, et le toc&#383;in &#383;onne de toutes
parts;"</i> ["It is, however, the country people who take up arms
again&#383;t us, and the alarm is &#383;ounded from all quarters."]
&#383;o that the French will, in fact, have created a public debt
of &#383;o &#383;ingular a nature, that every one will avoid as
much as po&#383;&#383;ible making any demand of the capital.</p>
<p>I have already been more diffu&#383;e than I intended on the
&#383;ubject of finance; but I beg you to ob&#383;erve, that I do
not affect to calculate, or &#383;peculate, and that I rea&#383;on
only from facts which are daily within my notice, and which, as
tending to operate on the morals of the people, are naturally
included in the plan I propo&#383;ed to my&#383;elf.</p>
<p>I have been here but a few days, and intend returning to-morrow.
I left Mrs. D____ very little better, and the di&#383;affection of
Dumouriez, which I ju&#383;t now learn, may oblige us to remove to
&#383;ome place not on the route to Paris.&mdash;Every one looks
alert and important, and a phy&#383;iognomi&#383;t may perceive
that regret is not the prevailing &#383;entiment&mdash;</p>

<h2>Amiens, April 7, 1793.</h2>
<p>If the &#383;entiments of the people towards their pre&#383;ent
government had been problematical before, the vi&#383;ible effect
of Dumouriez' conduct would afford an ample &#383;olution of the
problem. That indifference about public affairs which the
pro&#383;pect of an e&#383;tabli&#383;hed de&#383;poti&#383;m had
begun to create has vani&#383;hed&mdash;all is hope and
expectation&mdash;the doors of tho&#383;e who retail the
new&#383;papers are a&#383;&#383;ailed by people too impatient to
read them&mdash; each with his gazette in his hand li&#383;tens
eagerly to the verbal circulation, and then holds a &#383;ecret
conference with his neighbour, and calculates how long it may be
before Dumouriez can reach Paris. A fortnight ago the name of
Dumouriez was not uttered but in a tone of har&#383;hne&#383;s and
contempt, and, if ever it excited any thing like complacency, it
was when he announced defeats and lo&#383;&#383;es. Now he i&#383;
&#383;poken of with a &#383;ignificant modulation of voice, it is
di&#383;covered that he has great talents, and his popularity with
the army is de&#383;canted upon with a my&#383;terious air of
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed &#383;ati&#383;faction.&mdash;Tho&#383;e
who were extremely apprehen&#383;ive le&#383;t part of the
General's troops &#383;hould be driven this way by the
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es of the enemy, &#383;eem to talk with
perfect compo&#383;ure of their taking the &#383;ame route to
attack the capital; while others, who would have been unwilling to
receive either Dumouriez or hi&#383; army as peaceful fugitives,
will be "nothing loath" to admit them a&#383; conquerors. From all
I can learn, the&#383;e di&#383;po&#383;itions are very general,
and, indeed, the actual tyranny is &#383;o great, and the
per&#383;pective &#383;o alarming, that any means of deliverance
mu&#383;t be acceptable. But whatever may be the event, though I
cannot be per&#383;onally intere&#383;ted, if I thought Dumouriez
really propo&#383;ed to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a good government,
humanity would render one anxious for his &#383;ucce&#383;s; for it
is not to be di&#383;gui&#383;ed, that France is at this moment (as
the General him&#383;elf expre&#383;&#383;ed it) under the joint
dominion of <i>"imbecille&#383;"</i> and <i>"brigands."</i> [Ideots
and robbers.]</p>
<p>It is po&#383;&#383;ible, that at this moment the whole army is
di&#383;affected, and that the fortified towns are prepared to
&#383;urrender. It is al&#383;o certain, that Brittany is in
revolt, and that many other departments are little &#383;hort of
it; yet you will not very ea&#383;ily conceive what may have
occupied the Convention during part of this important
cri&#383;i&#383;&mdash;nothing le&#383;s than inventing a
dre&#383;s for their Commi&#383;&#383;ioner&#383;! But, as Sterne
&#383;ays, "it i&#383; the &#383;pirit of the nation;" and I
recollect no circum&#383;tance during the whole progre&#383;s of
the revolution (however &#383;erious) that has not been mixed with
frivolities of this kind.</p>
<p>I know not what effect this new co&#383;tume may produce on the
rebels or the enemy, but I confe&#383;s it appears to me more
ludicrous than formidable, e&#383;pecially when a
repre&#383;entative happens to be of the &#383;hape and
feature&#383; of the one we have here. Saladin, Deputy for this
department, and an advocate of the town of Amiens, has already
inve&#383;ted him&#383;elf with thi&#383; armour of inviolability;
"&#383;trange figure in &#383;uch &#383;trange habiliments," that
one is tempted to forget that Baratraria and the government of
Sancho are the creation of fancy. Imagine to your&#383;elf a
&#383;hort fat man, of &#383;allow complexion and &#383;mall eyes,
with a &#383;a&#383;h of white, red, and blue round his wai&#383;t,
a black belt with a &#383;word &#383;u&#383;pended acro&#383;s
hi&#383; &#383;houlders, and a round hat turned up before, with
three feathers of the national colours: "even &#383;uch a man" is
our repre&#383;entative, and exerci&#383;e&#383; a more
de&#383;potic authority than mo&#383;t Princes in Europe.&mdash;He
is accompanied by another Deputy, who was what is called Pere de la
Oratoire before the revolution&mdash;that is, in a &#383;tation
nearly approaching to that of an under-ma&#383;ter at our public
&#383;chools; only that the &#383;eminaries to which the&#383;e
were attached being very numerous, tho&#383;e employed in them were
little con&#383;idered. They wore the habit, and were &#383;ubject
to the &#383;ame re&#383;trictions, as the Clergy, but were at
liberty to quit the profe&#383;&#383;ion and marry, if they
cho&#383;e.&mdash;I have been more particular in de&#383;cribing
this cla&#383;s of men, becau&#383;e they have every where taken an
active and &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful part in perverting and
mi&#383;leading the people: they are in the clubs, or the
municipalities, in the Convention, and in all elective
admini&#383;trations, and have been in mo&#383;t places remarkable
for their &#383;edition and violence.</p>
<p>Several rea&#383;ons may be a&#383;&#383;igned for the influence
and conduct of men who&#383;e &#383;ituation and habits, on a
fir&#383;t view, &#383;eem to oppo&#383;e both. In the fir&#383;t
ardour of reform it was determined, that all the ancient modes of
education &#383;hould be aboli&#383;hed; &#383;mall temporary
pen&#383;ions were allotted to the Profe&#383;&#383;ors of
Colleges, and their admi&#383;&#383;ion to the exerci&#383;e of
&#383;imilar functions in the intended new &#383;y&#383;tem was
left to future deci&#383;ion. From this time the di&#383;banded
oratorians, who knew it would be vain to re&#383;i&#383;t popular
authority, endeavoured to &#383;hare in it; or, at lea&#383;t, by
becoming zealous partizans of the revolution, to
e&#383;tabli&#383;h their claim&#383; to any offices or emoluments
which might be &#383;ub&#383;tituted for tho&#383;e they had been
deprived of. They enrolled them&#383;elves with the Jacobins,
courted the populace, and, by the talent of pronouncing Roman names
with empha&#383;is, and the &#383;tudy of rhetorical attitudes,
they became important to a&#383;&#383;ociates who were ignorant, or
nece&#383;&#383;ary to tho&#383;e who were de&#383;igning.</p>
<p>The little information generally po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed
by the middle cla&#383;&#383;es of life in France, is al&#383;o
another cau&#383;e of the comparative importance of tho&#383;e
who&#383;e profe&#383;&#383;ions had, in this re&#383;pect,
rai&#383;ed them &#383;omething above the common level. People of
condition, liberally educated, have unfortunately abandoned public
affairs for &#383;ome time; &#383;o that the incapacity of
&#383;ome, and the pride or de&#383;pondency of others, have, in a
manner, left the nation to the guidance of pedants, incendiaries,
and adventurers. Perhaps al&#383;o the animo&#383;ity with which
the de&#383;cription of men I allude to pur&#383;ued every thing
attached to the ancient government, may, in &#383;ome degree, have
proceeded from a de&#383;ire of revenge and retaliation. They were
not, it mu&#383;t be confe&#383;&#383;ed, treated formerly with the
regard due to per&#383;ons who&#383;e profe&#383;&#383;ion was in
it&#383;elf u&#383;eful and re&#383;pectable; and the wounds of
vanity are not ea&#383;ily cured, nor the vindictivene&#383;s of
little minds ea&#383;ily &#383;ati&#383;fied.</p>
<p>From the conduct and popular influence of the&#383;e Peres de
l'Oratoire, &#383;ome truths may be deduced not altogether
u&#383;ele&#383;s even to a country not liable to &#383;uch violent
reforms. It affords an example of the danger ari&#383;ing from
tho&#383;e &#383;udden and arbitrary innovations, which, by
depriving any part of the community of their u&#383;ual means of
living, and &#383;ub&#383;tituting no other, tempt them to
indemnify them&#383;elves by preying, in different ways, on their
fellow-citizens.&mdash;The daring and ignorant often become
depredators of private property; while tho&#383;e who have more
talents, and le&#383;s courage, endeavour to &#383;ucceed by the
artifices which conciliate public favour. I am not certain whether
the latter are not to be mo&#383;t dreaded of the two, for
tho&#383;e who make a trade of the confidence of the people
&#383;eldom fail to corrupt them&mdash;they find it more profitable
to flatter their pa&#383;&#383;ions than to enlighten their
under&#383;tandings; and a demagogue of this kind, who obtains an
office by exciting one popular in&#383;urrection, will make no
&#383;cruple of maintaining him&#383;elf in it by another. An
inferrence may likewi&#383;e be drawn of the great
nece&#383;&#383;ity of cultivating &#383;uch a degree of
u&#383;eful knowledge in the middle order of &#383;ociety, as may
not only prevent their being deceived by intere&#383;ted
adventurers them&#383;elves, but enable them to in&#383;truct the
people in their true intere&#383;ts, and re&#383;cue them from
becoming the in&#383;truments, and finally the victims, of fraud
and impo&#383;ture.&mdash;The in&#383;ult and oppre&#383;&#383;ion
which the nobility frequently experience from tho&#383;e who have
been promoted by the revolution, will, I tru&#383;t, be a
u&#383;eful le&#383;&#383;on in future to the great, who may be
inclined to arrogate too much from adventitiou&#383;
di&#383;tinctions, to forget that the earth we tread upon may one
day overwhelm us, and that the meane&#383;t of mankind may do us an
injury which it is not in the power even of the mo&#383;t exalted
to &#383;hield us from.</p>
<p>The inqui&#383;ition begins to grow &#383;o &#383;trict, that I
have thought it nece&#383;&#383;ary to-day to bury a
tran&#383;lation of Burke.&mdash;In times of ignorance and
barbarity, it was criminal to read the bible, and our Engli&#383;h
author is prohibited for a &#383;imilar rea&#383;on&mdash;that is,
to conceal from the people the errors of tho&#383;e who direct
them: and, indeed, Mr. Burke has written &#383;ome truths, which it
is of much more importance for the Convention to conceal, than it
could be to the Catholic prie&#383;ts to monopolize the divine
writings.&mdash;As far as it was po&#383;&#383;ible, Mr. Burke has
&#383;hown him&#383;elf a prophet: if he has not been completely
&#383;o, it was becau&#383;e he had a benevolent heart, and is the
native of a free country. By the one, he was prevented from
imagining the cruelties which the French have committed; by the
other, the extreme de&#383;poti&#383;m which they endure.</p>

<h2>April 20, 1793.</h2>
<p>Before the&#383;e halcyon days of freedom, the &#383;upremacy of
Paris was little felt in the provinces, except in dictating a new
fa&#383;hion in dre&#383;s, an improvement in the art of cookery,
or the invention of a minuet. At pre&#383;ent our imitations of the
capital are &#383;omething more &#383;erious; and if our obedience
be not quite &#383;o voluntary, it is much more implicit.
In&#383;tead of receiving fa&#383;hions from the Court, we take
them now from the <i>dames des balles,</i> [Market-women.] and the
municipality; and it mu&#383;t be allowed, that the imaginations of
our new &#383;overeigns much exceed tho&#383;e of the old in force
and originality.</p>
<p>The mode of pillaging the &#383;hops, for in&#383;tance, was
fir&#383;t devi&#383;ed by the Pari&#383;ian ladies, and has lately
been adopted with great &#383;ucce&#383;s in the departments; the
vi&#383;ite domiciliaire, al&#383;o, which I look upon as a
mo&#383;t ingenious effort of fancy, is an emanation from the
commune of Paris, and has had an univer&#383;al run.&mdash;But it
would be vain to attempt enumerating all the obligations of this
kind which we owe to the indulgence of that virtuous city: our
la&#383;t importation, however, is of &#383;o &#383;ingular a
nature, that, were we not daily a&#383;&#383;ured all the liberty
in the world centers in Paris, I &#383;hould be doubtful as to its
tendency. It has lately been decreed, that every hou&#383;e in the
republic &#383;hall have fixed on the out&#383;ide of the door, in
legible characters, the name, age, birth-place, and
profe&#383;&#383;ion of its inhabitants. Not the poore&#383;t
cottager, nor tho&#383;e who are too old or too young for action,
nor even unmarried ladies, are exempt from thus proclaiming the
ab&#383;tract of their hi&#383;tory to pa&#383;&#383;ers-by.
&mdash;The reigning party judge very wi&#383;ely, that all
tho&#383;e who are not already their enemies may become &#383;o,
and that tho&#383;e who are unable to take a part them&#383;elves
may excite others: but, whatever may be the intention of this
mea&#383;ure, it is impo&#383;&#383;ible to conceive any thing
which could better &#383;erve the purpo&#383;es of an arbitrary
government; it place&#383; every individual in the republic within
the immediate reach of informer&#383; and &#383;pie&#383;&mdash;it
points out tho&#383;e who are of an age to &#383;erve in the
army&mdash; tho&#383;e who have &#383;ought refuge in one
department from the per&#383;ecutions of another&mdash;and, in
&#383;hort, whether a victim is pur&#383;ued by the denunciation of
private malice, or political &#383;u&#383;picion, it renders
e&#383;cape almo&#383;t impracticable.</p>
<p>We have had two domiciliary vi&#383;its within the la&#383;t
fortnight&mdash;one to &#383;earch for arms, the other under
pretext of a&#383;certaining the number of troops each hou&#383;e
is capable of lodging. But this was only the pretext, becau&#383;e
the municipalities always quarter troops as they think proper,
without con&#383;idering whether you have room or not; and the real
object of this inqui&#383;ition was to ob&#383;erve if the
inhabitants an&#383;wered to the li&#383;t&#383; placed on the
doors.&mdash;Mrs. D____ was ill in bed, but you mu&#383;t not
imagine &#383;uch a circum&#383;tance deterred the&#383;e gallant
republicans from entering her room with an armed force, to
calculate how many &#383;oldiers might be lodged in the bedchamber
of a &#383;ick female! The French, indeed, had never, in my
remembrance, any preten&#383;ions to delicacy, or even decency, and
they are certainly not improved in the&#383;e re&#383;pects by the
revolution.</p>
<p>It is curious in walking the &#383;treets, to ob&#383;erve the
devices of the &#383;everal cla&#383;&#383;es of ari&#383;tocracy;
for it is not to be di&#383;gui&#383;ed, that &#383;ince the hope
from Dumouriez has vani&#383;hed, though the di&#383;gu&#383;t of
the people may be increa&#383;ed, their terror is al&#383;o greater
than ever, and the departments near Paris have no re&#383;ource but
&#383;ilent &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion. Every one, therefore, obeys
the letter of the decrees with the diligence of fear, while they
elude the &#383;pirit of them with all the ingenuity of hatred. The
rich, for example, who cannot entirely dive&#383;t them&#383;elves
of their remaining hauteur, exhibit a &#383;ullen compliance on a
&#383;mall piece of paper, written in a &#383;mall hand, and placed
at the very extreme of the height allowed by the law. Some fix
their bills &#383;o as to be half covered by a &#383;hutter; others
fa&#383;ten them only with wafers, &#383;o that the wind detaching
one or two corners, makes it impo&#383;&#383;ible to read the
re&#383;t.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This contrivance became &#383;o common, that an
article was obliged to be added to the decree, importing, that
whenever the papers were damaged or effaced by the weather, or

under a penalty.</blockquote>

<p>Many who have courts or pa&#383;&#383;ages to their hou&#383;es,

indivi&#383;ible."</i> ["The republic, one and indivi&#383;ible for
ever!"] Some likewi&#383;e, who are in public offices, or
&#383;hopkeepers who are very timid, and afraid of pillage, or are
ripe for a counter-revolution, have a &#383;heet half the &#383;ize
of the door, decorated with red caps, tri-coloured ribbons, and
flaming &#383;entences ending in "Death or Liberty!"</p>
<p>If, however, the French government confined it&#383;elf to
the&#383;e petty acts of de&#383;poti&#383;m, I would endeavour to
be reconciled to it; but I really begin to have &#383;erious
apprehen&#383;ions, not &#383;o much for our &#383;afety as our
tranquillity, and if I con&#383;idered only my&#383;elf, I
&#383;hould not he&#383;itate to return to England. Mrs. D____ is
too ill to travel far at pre&#383;ent, and her dread of
cro&#383;&#383;ing the &#383;ea makes her le&#383;s
di&#383;po&#383;ed to think our &#383;ituation here hazardous or
ineligible. Mr. D____, too, who, without being a republican or a
partizan of the pre&#383;ent &#383;y&#383;tem, has always been a
friend to the fir&#383;t revolution, is unwilling to believe the
Convention &#383;o bad as there is every rea&#383;on to
&#383;uppo&#383;e it. I therefore let my judgement yield to my
friend&#383;hip, and, as I cannot prevail on them to depart, the
danger which may attend our remaining is an additional rea&#383;on
for my not quitting them.</p>
<p>The national perfidy which has always di&#383;tingui&#383;hed
France among the other countries of Europe, &#383;eems now not to
be more a diplomatic principle, than a rule of dome&#383;tic
government. It is &#383;o extended and generalized, that an
individual is as much liable to be deceived and betrayed by
confiding in a decree, as a foreign power would be by relying on
the faith of a treaty.&mdash;An hundred and twenty prie&#383;ts,
above &#383;ixty years of age, who had not taken the oaths, but who
were allowed to remain by the &#383;ame law that bani&#383;hed
tho&#383;e who were younger, have been lately arre&#383;ted, and
are confined together in a hou&#383;e which was once a college. The
people did not behold this act of cruelty with indifference, but,
awed by an armed force, and the pre&#383;ence of the
Commi&#383;&#383;ioners of the Convention, they could only follow
the prie&#383;ts to their pri&#383;on with &#383;ilent regret and
internal horror. They, however, venture even now to mark their
attachment, by taking all opportunities of &#383;eeing them, and
&#383;upplying them with nece&#383;&#383;aries, which it is not
very difficult to do, a&#383; they are guarded by the Bourgeois,
who are generally inclined to favour them. I a&#383;ked a woman
to-day if &#383;he &#383;till contrived to have acce&#383;s to the
prie&#383;ts, and &#383;he replied, <i>"Ah, oui, il y a encore de
la facilite, par ce que l'on ne trouve pas des gardes ici qui ne
&#383;ont pas pour eux."</i>*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* "Yes, yes, we &#383;till contive it, becau&#383;e
there are no guards to be found here who don't befriend
them."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, even the mo&#383;t minute and be&#383;t organized tyranny
may be eluded; and, indeed, if all the agents of this government
acted in the &#383;pirit of it&#383; decrees, it would be
in&#383;upportable even to a native of Turkey or Japan. But if
&#383;ome have &#383;till a remnant of humanity left, there are a
&#383;ufficient number who execute the laws as unfeelingly as they
are conceived.</p>
<p>When the&#383;e poor prie&#383;ts were to be removed from their
&#383;everal hou&#383;es, it was found nece&#383;&#383;ary to
di&#383;lodge the Bi&#383;hop of Amiens, who had for &#383;ome time
occupied the place fixed on for their reception. The Bi&#383;hop
had notice given him at twelve o'clock in the day to
relinqui&#383;h his lodging before evening; yet the Bi&#383;hop of
Amiens is a con&#383;titutional Prelate, and had, before the
revolution, the cure of a large pari&#383;h at Paris; nor wa&#383;
it without much per&#383;ua&#383;ion that he accepted the &#383;ee
of Amiens. In the &#383;evere winter of 1789 he di&#383;po&#383;ed
of his plate and library, (the latter of which was &#383;aid to be
one of the be&#383;t private collections in Paris,) to
purcha&#383;e bread for the poor. "But Time hath a wallet on his
back, wherein he puts alms for oblivion;" and the charities of the
Bi&#383;hop could not &#383;hield him from the contempt and
in&#383;ult which pur&#383;ue his profe&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>I have been much di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed within the la&#383;t
few days on account of my friend Madame de B____. I &#383;ubjoining
a tran&#383;lation of a letter I have ju&#383;t received from her,
as it will convey to you hereafter a tolerable &#383;pecimen of
French liberty.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>"Mai&#383;on de Arret, at ____. "I did not write to
you, my dear friend, at the time I promi&#383;ed, and you will
perceive, by the date of this, that I have had too good an
excu&#383;e for my negligence. I have been here almo&#383;t a week,
and my &#383;pirits are &#383;till &#383;o much di&#383;ordered,
that I can with difficulty recollect my&#383;elf enough to relate
the circum&#383;tances of our unfortunate &#383;ituation; but as it
is po&#383;&#383;ible you might become acquainted with them by
&#383;ome other means, I rather determined to &#383;end you a few
lines, than &#383;uffer you to be alarmed by fal&#383;e or
exaggerated reports. "About two o'clock on Monday morning la&#383;t
our &#383;ervants were called up, and, on their opening the door,
the hou&#383;e was immediately filled with armed men, &#383;ome of
whom began &#383;earching the rooms, while other&#383; came to our
bedchamber, and informed us we were arre&#383;ted by order of the
department, and that we mu&#383;t ri&#383;e and accompany them to
pri&#383;on. It is not ea&#383;y to de&#383;cribe the effect of
&#383;uch a mandate on people who, having nothing to reproach
them&#383;elves with, could not be prepared for it.&mdash;As
&#383;oon as we were a little recovered from our fir&#383;t
terrors, we endeavoured to obey, and begged they would indulge us
by retiring a few moments till I had put my clothes on; but neither
my embarra&#383;&#383;ment, nor the &#383;creams of the
child&mdash;neither decency nor humanity, could prevail. They would
not even permit my maid to enter the room; and, amid&#383;t this
&#383;cene of di&#383;order, I wa&#383; obliged to dre&#383;s
my&#383;elf and the terrified infant. When thi&#383;
unplea&#383;ant ta&#383;k was fini&#383;hed, a general examination
of our hou&#383;e and papers took place, and la&#383;ted until
&#383;ix in the evening: nothing, however, tending in the
remote&#383;t degree to criminate us was found, but we were
neverthele&#383;s conducted to pri&#383;on, and God knows how long
we are likely to remain here. The denunciation again&#383;t us
being &#383;ecret, and not being able to learn either our crime or
our accu&#383;ers, it is difficult for us to take any mea&#383;ures
for our enlargement. We cannot defend our&#383;elves again&#383;t a
charge of which we are ignorant, nor combat the validity of a
witne&#383;s, who is not only allowed to remain &#383;ecret, but is
paid perhaps for hi&#383; information.* * At this time informers
were paid from fifty to an hundred livres for each accu&#383;ation.
"We mo&#383;t probably owe our mi&#383;fortune to &#383;ome
di&#383;carded &#383;ervant or per&#383;onal enemy, for I believe
you are convinced we have not merited it either by our
di&#383;cour&#383;e or our actions: if we had, the charge would
have been &#383;pecific; but we have rea&#383;on to imagine it
i&#383; nothing more than the indeterminate and general charge of
being ari&#383;tocrates. I did not &#383;ee my mother or
&#383;i&#383;ter all the day we were arre&#383;ted, nor till the
evening of the next: the one was engaged perhaps with "Ro&#383;ine
and the Angola", who were indi&#383;po&#383;ed, and the other would
not forego her u&#383;ual card-party. Many of our friend&#383;
likewi&#383;e have forborne to approach us, le&#383;t their
apparent intere&#383;t in our fate &#383;hould involve
them&#383;elves; and really the alarm is &#383;o general, that I
can, without much effort, forgive them. "You will be plea&#383;ed
to learn, that the greate&#383;t civilities I have received in this
unplea&#383;ant &#383;ituation, have been from &#383;ome of your
countrymen, who are our fellow-pri&#383;oners: they are only poor
&#383;ailors, but they are truly kind and attentive, and do us
variou&#383; little &#383;ervices that render us more comfortable
than we otherwi&#383;e &#383;hould be; for we have no &#383;ervants
here, having deemed it prudent to leave them to take care of our
property. The &#383;econd night we were here, the&#383;e good
creatures, who lodge in the next room, were rather merry, and awoke
the child; but as they found, by its cries, that their gaiety had
occa&#383;ioned me &#383;ome trouble, I have ob&#383;erved ever
&#383;ince that they walk &#383;oftly, and avoid making the
lea&#383;t noi&#383;e, after the little pri&#383;oner is gone to
re&#383;t. I believe they are plea&#383;ed with me becau&#383;e I
&#383;peak their language, and they are &#383;till more delighted
with your young favourite, who is &#383;o well amu&#383;ed, that he
begins to forget the gloom of the place, which at fir&#383;t
terrified him extremely. "One of our companions is a nonjuring
prie&#383;t, who has been impri&#383;oned under circum&#383;tances
which make me almo&#383;t a&#383;hamed of my country.&mdash;After
having e&#383;caped from a neighbouring department, he procured
him&#383;elf a lodging in this town, and for &#383;ome time lived
very peaceably, till a woman, who &#383;u&#383;pected his
profe&#383;&#383;ion, became extremely importunate with him to
confe&#383;s her. The poor man, for &#383;everal days,
refu&#383;ed, telling her, that he did not con&#383;ider
him&#383;elf as a prie&#383;t, nor wi&#383;hed to be known as
&#383;uch, nor to infringe the law which excluded him. The woman,
however, &#383;till continued to per&#383;ecute him, alledging,
that her con&#383;cience was di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed, and that
her peace depended on her being able to confe&#383;s "in the right
way." At length he &#383;uffered him&#383;elf to be prevailed
upon&mdash;the woman received an hundred livres for informing
again&#383;t him, and, perhaps, the prie&#383;t will be condemned
to the Guillotine.* * He was executed &#383;ome time after. "I will
make no reflection on this act, nor on the &#383;y&#383;tem of
paying informer&#383;&mdash;your heart will already have
anticipated all I could &#383;ay. I will only add, that if you
determine to remain in France, you mu&#383;t ob&#383;erve a degree
of circum&#383;pection which you may not hitherto have thought
nece&#383;&#383;ary. Do not depend on your innocence, nor even
tru&#383;t to common precaution&#383;&mdash;every day
furni&#383;hes examples that both are
unavailing.&mdash;Adieu.&mdash;My hu&#383;band offers you his
re&#383;pects, and your little friend embraces you &#383;incerely.
As &#383;oon as any change in our favour takes place, I will
communicate it to you; but you had better not venture to
write&mdash;I entru&#383;t this to Loui&#383;on's mother, who
i&#383; going through Amiens, as it would be un&#383;afe to
&#383;end it by the po&#383;t. &mdash;Again adieu.&mdash;Yours,
"Adelaide de ____." Amiens, 1793.</blockquote>

<p>It is ob&#383;ervable, that we examine le&#383;s
&#383;crupulou&#383;ly the preten&#383;ions of a nation to any
particular excellence, than we do tho&#383;e of an individual. The
rea&#383;on of this is, probably, that our &#383;elf-love is as
much gratified by admitting the one, as in rejecting the other.
When we allow the claims of a whole people, we are flattered with
the idea of being above narrow prejudices, and of
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing an enlarged and liberal mind; but if
a &#383;ingle individual arrogate to him&#383;elf any
exclu&#383;ive &#383;uperiority, our own pride immediately becomes
oppo&#383;ed to his, and we &#383;eem but to vindicate our
judgement in degrading &#383;uch pre&#383;umption.</p>
<p>I can conceive no other cau&#383;es for our having &#383;o long
acquie&#383;ced in the claims of the French to pre-eminent good
breeding, in an age when, I believe, no per&#383;on acquainted with
both nations can di&#383;cover any thing to ju&#383;tify them. If
indeed politene&#383;s con&#383;i&#383;ted in the repetition of a
certain routine of phra&#383;es, unconnected with the mind or
action, I might be obliged to decide again&#383;t our country; but
while decency makes a part of good manners, or feeling is
preferable to a mechanical jargon, I am inclined to think the
Engli&#383;h have a merit more than they have hitherto
a&#383;cribed to them&#383;elves. Do not &#383;uppo&#383;e,
however, that I am going to de&#383;cant on the old imputations of
"French flattery," and "French in&#383;incerity;" for I am far from
concluding that civil behaviour gives one a right to expect kind
offices, or that a man is fal&#383;e becau&#383;e he pays a
compliment, and refu&#383;es a &#383;ervice: I only wi&#383;h to
infer, that an impertinence is not le&#383;s an impertinence
becau&#383;e it is accompanied by a certain &#383;et of words, and
that a people, who are indelicate to exce&#383;s, cannot properly
be denominated "a polite people."</p>
<p>A French man or woman, with no other apology than <i>"permettez
moi,"</i> ["Give me leave."] will take a book out of your hand,
look over any thing you are reading, and a&#383;k you a
thou&#383;and que&#383;tions relative to your mo&#383;t private
concern&#383;&mdash;they will enter your room, even your
bedchamber, without knocking, place them&#383;elves between you and
the fire, or take hold of your clothes to gue&#383;s what they
co&#383;t; and they deem the&#383;e acts of rudene&#383;s
&#383;ufficiently qualified by <i>"Je demande bien de pardons."</i>
["I a&#383;k you a thou&#383;and pardons."]&mdash;They are fully
convinced that the Engli&#383;h all eat with their knives, and I
have often heard this di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed with much
&#383;elf-complacence by tho&#383;e who u&#383;ually &#383;hared
the labours of the repa&#383;t between a fork and their fingers.
Our cu&#383;tom al&#383;o of u&#383;ing water-gla&#383;&#383;es
after dinner is an object of particular cen&#383;ure; yet whoever
dines at a French table mu&#383;t frequently ob&#383;erve, that
many of the gue&#383;t&#383; might benefit by &#383;uch ablutions,
and their napkins always te&#383;tify that &#383;ome previous
application would be by no means &#383;uperfluous. Nothing i&#383;
more common than to hear phy&#383;ical derangements,
di&#383;orders, and their remedies, expatiated upon by the parties
concerned amid&#383;t a room full of people, and that with &#383;o
much minutene&#383;s of de&#383;cription, that a foreigner, without
being very fa&#383;tidious, is on &#383;ome occa&#383;ions apt to
feel very unplea&#383;ant &#383;ympathies. There are &#383;carcely
any of the ceremonies of a lady's toilette more a my&#383;tery to
one &#383;ex than the other, and men and their wives, who
&#383;carcely eat at the &#383;ame table, are in thi&#383;
re&#383;pect gro&#383;&#383;ly familiar. The conver&#383;ation in
mo&#383;t &#383;ocieties partakes of this indecency, and the
manners of an Engli&#383;h female are in danger of becoming
contaminated, while &#383;he is only endeavouring to &#383;uffer
without pain the cu&#383;toms of tho&#383;e &#383;he has been
taught to con&#383;ider as models of politene&#383;s.</p>
<p>Whether you examine the French in their hou&#383;es or in
public, you are every where &#383;tricken with the &#383;ame want
of delicacy, propriety, and cleanline&#383;s. The &#383;treets are
mo&#383;tly &#383;o filthy, that it is perilous to approach the
walls. The in&#383;ides of the churches are often
di&#383;gu&#383;ting, in &#383;pite of the adverti&#383;ements that
are placed in them to reque&#383;t the forbearance of phthifical
per&#383;ons: the &#383;ervice does not prevent tho&#383;e who
attend from going to and fro with the &#383;ame irreverence as if
the church were empty; and, in the mo&#383;t &#383;olemn part of
the ma&#383;s, a woman is &#383;uffered to importune you for a
liard, as the price of the chair you &#383;it on. At the theatres
an actor or actre&#383;s frequently coughs and expectorates on the
&#383;tage, in a manner one &#383;hould think highly unpardonable
before one'&#383; mo&#383;t intimate friends in England, though
this habit is very common to all the French. The inns abound with
filth of every kind, and though the owners of them are generally
civil enough, their notions of what i&#383; decent are &#383;o very
different from ours, that an Engli&#383;h traveller is not
&#383;oon reconciled to them. In &#383;hort, it would be
impo&#383;&#383;ible to enumerate all that in my opinion excludes
the French from the character of a well-bred people.&mdash;Swift,
who &#383;eems to have been gratified by the contemplation of
phy&#383;ical impurity, might have done the &#383;ubject
ju&#383;tice; but I confe&#383;s I am not di&#383;plea&#383;ed to
feel that, after my long and frequent re&#383;idences in France, I
am &#383;till unqualified. So little are the&#383;e people
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of delicacy, propriety, and decency, that
they do not even u&#383;e the words in the &#383;en&#383;e we do,
nor have they any other&#383; expre&#383;&#383;ive of the &#383;ame
meaning.</p>
<p>But if they be deficient in the external forms of
politene&#383;s, they are infinitely more &#383;o in that
politene&#383;s which may be called mental. The &#383;imple and
unerring rule of never preferring one's &#383;elf, is to them more
difficult of comprehen&#383;ion than the mo&#383;t difficult
problem in Euclid: in &#383;mall things as well as great, their own
intere&#383;t, their own gratification, is their leading principle;
and the cold flexibility which enables them to clothe this
&#383;elfi&#383;h &#383;y&#383;tem in "fair forms," is what they
call politene&#383;s.</p>
<p>My ideas on this &#383;ubject are not recent, but they occurred
to me with additional force on the peru&#383;al of Mad. de B____'s
letter. The behaviour of &#383;ome of the poore&#383;t and
lea&#383;t informed cla&#383;s of our countrymen forms a
&#383;triking contra&#383;t with that of the people who
arre&#383;ted her, and even her own friends: the unaffected
attention of the one, and the brutality and neglect of the other,
are, perhaps, more ju&#383;t examples of Engli&#383;h and French
manners than you may have hitherto imagined. I do not, however,
pretend to &#383;ay that the latter are all gro&#383;s and brutal,
but I am my&#383;elf convinced that, generally &#383;peaking, they
are an unfeeling people.</p>
<p>I beg you to remember, that when I &#383;peak of the
di&#383;po&#383;itions and character of the French, my opinions are
the re&#383;ult of general ob&#383;ervation, and are applicable to
all ranks; but when my remarks are on habits and manners, they
de&#383;cribe only tho&#383;e cla&#383;&#383;es which are properly
called the nation. The higher noble&#383;&#383;e, and tho&#383;e
attached to courts, &#383;o nearly re&#383;emble each other in all
countries, that they are nece&#383;&#383;arily excepted in
the&#383;e delineations, which are intended to mark the
di&#383;tingui&#383;hing features of a people at large: for,
a&#383;&#383;uredly, when the French a&#383;&#383;ert, and their
neighbours repeat, that they are a polite nation, it is not meant
that tho&#383;e who have important offices or dignified
appellations are polite: they found their claims on their
&#383;uperiority as a people, and it is in this light I
con&#383;ider them. My examples are chiefly drawn, not from the
very inferior, nor from the mo&#383;t eminent ranks; neither from
the retailer of a &#383;hop, nor the claimant of a
<i>tabouret,</i>* or <i>les grandes ou petites entrees;</i> but
from the gentry, tho&#383;e of ea&#383;y fortunes, merchants,
&amp;c.&mdash;in fact, from people of that degree which it would be
fair to cite as what may be called genteel &#383;ociety in
England.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The tabouret was a &#383;tool allowed to the Ladies
of the Court particularly di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by rank or
favour, when in pre&#383;ence of the Royal Family.&mdash;"Les
entree&#383;" gave a familiar acce&#383;s to the King and
Queen.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This ce&#383;&#383;ation of intercour&#383;e with our country
di&#383;pirits me, and, as it will probably continue &#383;ome
time, I &#383;hall amu&#383;e my&#383;elf by noting more
particularly the little occurrences which may not reach your public
prints, but which tend more than great events to mark both the
&#383;pirit of the government and that of the people.&mdash;Perhaps
you may be ignorant that the prohibition of the Engli&#383;h mails
was not the con&#383;equence of a decree of the Convention, but a
&#383;imple order of its commi&#383;&#383;ioners; and I have
&#383;ome rea&#383;on to think that even they acted at the
in&#383;tigation of an individual who harbours a mean and pitiful
di&#383;like to England and it&#383; inhabitants.&mdash;Yours,

<h2>May 18, 1793.</h2>
<p>Near &#383;ix weeks ago a decree was pa&#383;&#383;ed by the
Convention, obliging all &#383;trangers, who had not purcha&#383;ed
national property, or who did not exerci&#383;e &#383;ome
profe&#383;&#383;ion, to give &#383;ecurity to the amount of half
their &#383;uppo&#383;ed fortune, and under the&#383;e conditions
they were to receive a certificate, allowing them to re&#383;ide,
and were promi&#383;ed the protection of the laws. The
admini&#383;trators of the departments, who perceive that they
become odious by executing the decrees of the Convention, begin to
relax much of their diligence, and it is not till long after a law
i&#383; promulgated, and their per&#383;onal fear operates as a
&#383;timulant, that they &#383;eriou&#383;ly enforce obedience to
the&#383;e mandates. This morning, however, we were &#383;ummoned
by the Committee of our &#383;ection (or ward) in order to comply
with the terms of the decree, and had I been directed only by my
own judgement, I &#383;hould have given the preference to an
immediate return to England; but Mrs. D____ is yet ill, and Mr.
D____ is di&#383;po&#383;ed to continue. In vain have I quoted "how
fickle France was branded 'mid&#383;t the nations of the earth for
perfidy and breach of public faith;" in vain have I rea&#383;oned
upon the inju&#383;tice of a government that fir&#383;t allured
&#383;trangers to remain by in&#383;idious offers of protection,
and now &#383;ubject&#383; them to conditions which many may find
it difficult to &#383;ub&#383;cribe to: Mr. D____ wi&#383;hes to
&#383;ee our &#383;ituation in the mo&#383;t favourable point of
view: he argues upon the moral impo&#383;&#383;ibility of our being
liable to any inconvenience, and per&#383;i&#383;ts in believing
that one government may act with treachery towards another, yet,
di&#383;tingui&#383;hing between fal&#383;ehood and meanne&#383;s,
maintain its faith with individual&#383;&mdash;in &#383;hort, we
have concluded a &#383;ort of treaty, by which we are bound, under
the forfeiture of a large &#383;um, to behave peaceably and
&#383;ubmit to the laws. The government, in return, empowers us to
re&#383;ide, and promi&#383;es protection and ho&#383;pitality.</p>
<p>It is to be ob&#383;erved, that the &#383;pirit of this
regulation depends upon tho&#383;e it affects producing &#383;ix
witne&#383;&#383;es of their <i>"civi&#383;me;"</i>* yet &#383;o
little intere&#383;t do the people take on the&#383;e
occa&#383;ions, that our witne&#383;&#383;e&#383; were neighbours
we had &#383;carcely ever &#383;een, and even one was a man who
happened to be ca&#383;ually pa&#383;&#383;ing by.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Though the meaning of this word is obvious, we have
no one that i&#383; exactly &#383;ynonymous to it. The Convention
intend by it an attachment to their government: but the people do
not trouble them&#383;elves about the meaning of
word&#383;&mdash;they mea&#383;ure their unwilling obedience by the
letter.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The&#383;e Committees, which form the la&#383;t link of a chain
of de&#383;poti&#383;m, are compo&#383;ed of low trade&#383;men and
day-labourers, with an attorney, or &#383;ome per&#383;on that can
read and write, at their head, as Pre&#383;ident. Prie&#383;ts and
nobles, with all that are related, or anywi&#383;e attached, to
them, are excluded by the law; and it is under&#383;tood that true
&#383;ans-culottes only &#383;hould be admitted.</p>
<p>With all the&#383;e precautions, the indifference and hatred of
the people to their government are &#383;o general, that, perhaps,
there are few place&#383; where this regulation is executed &#383;o
as to an&#383;wer the purpo&#383;es of the jealous tyranny that
conceived it. The members of the&#383;e Committees &#383;eem to
exact no farther compliances than &#383;uch as are ab&#383;olutely
nece&#383;&#383;ary to the mere form of the proceeding, and to
&#383;ecure them&#383;elves from the imputation of
di&#383;obedience; and are very little concerned whether the real
de&#383;ign of the legi&#383;lature be accompli&#383;hed or not.
This negligence, or ill-will, which prevails in various
in&#383;tances, tempers, in &#383;ome degree, the effect of that
re&#383;tle&#383;s &#383;u&#383;picion which is the u&#383;ual
concomitant of an uncertain, but arbitrary, power. The affections
or prejudices that &#383;urround a throne, by en&#383;uring the
&#383;afety of the Monarch, engage him to clemency, and the laws of
a mild government are, for the mo&#383;t part, enforced with
exactne&#383;s; but a new and precarious authority, which neither
impo&#383;es on the under&#383;tanding nor intere&#383;ts the
heart, which is &#383;upported only by a palpable and unadorned
tyranny, is in its nature &#383;evere, and it becomes the common
cau&#383;e of the people to counteract the mea&#383;ures of a
de&#383;poti&#383;m which they are unable to
re&#383;i&#383;t.&mdash;This (as I have before had occa&#383;ion to
ob&#383;erve) renders the condition of the French le&#383;&#383;
in&#383;upportable, but it is by no means &#383;ufficient to
bani&#383;h the fears of a &#383;tranger who has been
accu&#383;tomed to look for &#383;ecurity, not from a relaxation or
di&#383;regard of the laws, but from their efficacy; not from the
characters of tho&#383;e who execute them, but from the rectitude
with which they are formed.&mdash;What would you think in England,
if you were obliged to contemplate with dread the three branches of
your legi&#383;lature, and depend for the protection of your
per&#383;on and property on &#383;oldiers and con&#383;tables? Yet
&#383;uch is nearly the &#383;tate we are in; and indeed a
&#383;y&#383;tem of inju&#383;tice and barbari&#383;m gains ground
&#383;o fa&#383;t, that almo&#383;t any apprehen&#383;ion is
ju&#383;tified.&mdash;The Tribunal Revolutionnaire has already
condemned a &#383;ervant maid for her political opinions; and one
of the Judges of this tribunal lately introduced a man to the
Jacobins, with high panegyrics, becau&#383;e, as he alledged, he
had greatly contributed to the condemnation of a criminal. The
&#383;ame Judge likewi&#383;e apologized for having as yet
&#383;ent but a &#383;mall number to the Guillotine, and
promi&#383;es, that, on the fir&#383;t appearance of a
"Bri&#383;&#383;otin" before him, he will &#383;how him no
mercy.</p>
<p>When the mini&#383;ter of public ju&#383;tice thus avows
him&#383;elf the agent of a party, a government, however recent its
formation, mu&#383;t be far advanced in depravity; and the
corruption of tho&#383;e who are the interpreters of the law has
u&#383;ually been the la&#383;t effort of expiring power.</p>
<p>My friends, Mons. And Mad. de B____, are relea&#383;ed from
their confinement; not as you might expect, by proving their
innocence, but by the effort&#383; of an individual, who had more
weight than their accu&#383;er: and, far from obtaining
&#383;ati&#383;faction for the injury they have received, they are
obliged to accept as a favour the liberty they were deprived of by
malice and inju&#383;tice. They will, mo&#383;t probably, never be
acquainted with the nature of the charges brought again&#383;t
them; and their accu&#383;er will e&#383;cape with impunity, and,
perhaps, meet with reward.</p>
<p>All the French papers are filled with de&#383;criptions of the
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m with which the young men "&#383;tart to
arm&#383;" [<i>Offian.</i>] at the voice of their country; yet it
is very certain, that this enthu&#383;ia&#383;m is of &#383;o
&#383;ubtle and aerial a form as to be perceivable only to
tho&#383;e who are intere&#383;ted in di&#383;covering it. In
&#383;ome places the&#383;e enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic warriors
continue to hide them&#383;elve&#383;&mdash;from others they are
e&#383;corted to the place of their de&#383;tination by nearly an
equal number of dragoons; and no one, I believe, who can procure
money to pay a &#383;ub&#383;titute, is di&#383;po&#383;ed to go
him&#383;elf. This is &#383;ufficiently proved by the &#383;ums
demanded by tho&#383;e who engage a&#383; &#383;ub&#383;titutes:
la&#383;t year from three to five hundred livres was given; at
pre&#383;ent no one will take le&#383;s than eight hundred or a
thou&#383;and, be&#383;ide&#383; being furni&#383;hed with clothes,
&amp;c. The only real volunteers are the &#383;on&#383; of
ari&#383;tocrates, and the relations of emigrants, who,
&#383;acrificing their principles to their fears, hope, by
enli&#383;ting in the army, to protect their e&#383;tates and
families: tho&#383;e likewi&#383;e who have lucrative employments,
and are afraid of lo&#383;ing them, affect great zeal, and expect
to purcha&#383;e impunity for civil peculation at home, by the
military &#383;ervices of their children abroad.</p>
<p>This, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, is the real &#383;tate of that
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m which occa&#383;ion&#383; &#383;uch an expence
of eloquence to our gazette-writers; but the&#383;e fallaciou&#383;
accounts are not like the ephemeral deceits of your party prints in
England, the effect of which is de&#383;troyed in a few hours by an
oppo&#383;ite a&#383;&#383;ertion. None here are bold enough to
contradict what their &#383;overeign&#383; would have believed; and
a town or di&#383;trict, driven almo&#383;t to revolt by the
pre&#383;ent &#383;y&#383;tem of recruiting, con&#383;ents very
willingly to be de&#383;cribed as marching to the frontiers with
martial ardour, and burning to combat les e&#383;claves des
tyran&#383;! By the&#383;e artifices, one department is mi&#383;led
with regard to the di&#383;po&#383;itions of another, and if they
do not excite to emulation, they, at lea&#383;t, repre&#383;s by
fear; and, probably, many are reduced to &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion,
who would re&#383;i&#383;t, were they not doubtful of the
&#383;upport and union of their neighbours. Every
po&#383;&#383;ible precaution i&#383; taken to prevent any
connections between the different department&#383;&mdash; people
who are not known cannot obtain pa&#383;&#383;ports without the
recommendation of two hou&#383;ekeeper&#383;&mdash;you mu&#383;t
give an account of the bu&#383;ine&#383;s you go upon, of the
carriage you mean to travel in, whether it has two wheels or four:
all of which mu&#383;t be &#383;pecified in your
pa&#383;&#383;port: and you cannot &#383;end your baggage from one
town to another without the ri&#383;k of having it &#383;earched.
All the&#383;e things are &#383;o di&#383;gu&#383;ting and
trouble&#383;ome, that I begin to be quite of a different opinion
from Brutus, and &#383;hould certainly prefer being a &#383;lave
among a free people, than thu&#383; be tormented with the
recollection that I am a native of England in a land of
&#383;lavery. Whatever liberty the French might have acquired by
their fir&#383;t revolution, it is now much like Sir John Cutler's
wor&#383;ted &#383;tockings, &#383;o torn, and worn, and
di&#383;gui&#383;ed by patchings and mendings, that the original
texture is not di&#383;coverable.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>June 3, 1793.</h2>
<p>We have been three days without receiving new&#383;papers; but
we learn from the reports of the courier, that the
Bri&#383;&#383;otins are overthrown, that many of them have been
arre&#383;ted, and &#383;everal e&#383;caped to rai&#383;e
adherents in the departments. I, however, doubt much if their
&#383;ucce&#383;s will be very general: the people have little
preference between Bri&#383;&#383;ot and Marat, Condorcet and
Robe&#383;pierre, and are not greatly &#383;olicitous about the
name&#383; or even principles of tho&#383;e who govern
them&mdash;they are not yet accu&#383;tomed to take that lively
intere&#383;t in public events which is the effect of a popular
con&#383;titution. In England every thing is a &#383;ubject of
debate and conte&#383;t, but here they wait in &#383;ilence the
re&#383;ult of any political mea&#383;ure or party di&#383;pute;
and, without entering into the merits of the cau&#383;e, adopt
whatever is &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful. While the King was yet
alive, the news of Paris was eagerly &#383;ought after, and every
di&#383;order of the metropolis created much alarm: but one would
almo&#383;t &#383;uppo&#383;e that even curio&#383;ity had
cea&#383;ed at his death, for I have ob&#383;erved no
&#383;ub&#383;equent event (except the defection of Dumouriez) make
any very &#383;eriou&#383; impre&#383;&#383;ion. We hear,
therefore, with great compo&#383;ure, the pre&#383;ent triumph of
the more violent republicans, and &#383;uffer without impatience
this interregnum of news, which is to continue until the Convention
&#383;hall have determined in what manner the intelligence of their
proceeding&#383; &#383;hall be related to the departments.</p>
<p>The great &#383;olicitude of the people is now rather about
their phy&#383;ical exi&#383;tence than their political
one&mdash;provi&#383;ions are become enormou&#383;ly dear, and
bread very &#383;carce: our &#383;ervants often wait two hours at
the baker's, and then return without bread for breakfa&#383;t. I
hope, however, the &#383;carcity is rather artificial than real. It
is generally &#383;uppo&#383;ed to be occa&#383;ioned by the
unwillingne&#383;s of the farmers to &#383;ell their corn for
paper. Some mea&#383;ures have been adopted with an intention of
remedying this evil, though the origin of it is beyond the reach of
decree. It originates in that di&#383;tru&#383;t of government
which reconciles one part of the community to &#383;tarving the
other, under the idea of &#383;elf-pre&#383;ervation. While every
individual per&#383;i&#383;ts in e&#383;tabli&#383;hing it as a
maxim, that any thing is better than a&#383;&#383;ignats, we
mu&#383;t expect that all things will be difficult to procure, and
will, of cour&#383;e, bear a high price. I fear, all the
empyrici&#383;m of the legi&#383;lature cannot produce a
no&#383;trum for thi&#383; want of faith. Dragoons and penal laws
only "linger, and linger it out;" the di&#383;ea&#383;e is
incurable.</p>
<p>My friends, Mons. and Mad. de B____, by way of con&#383;olation
for their impri&#383;onment, now find them&#383;elves on the
li&#383;t of emigrants, though they have never been a &#383;ingle
day ab&#383;ent from their own province, or from places of
re&#383;idence where they are well known. But that they may not
murmur at this inju&#383;tice, the municipality have accompanied
their name&#383; with tho&#383;e of others who have not even been
ab&#383;ent from the town, and of one gentleman in particular, who
I believe may have been &#383;een on the ramparts every day for
the&#383;e &#383;even years.&mdash;This may appear to you only very
ab&#383;urd, and you may imagine the con&#383;equences ea&#383;ily
obviated; yet the&#383;e mi&#383;takes are the effect of private
malice, and &#383;ubject the per&#383;on&#383; affected by them to
an infinity of expence and trouble. They are obliged, in order to
avert the confi&#383;cation of their property, to appear, in every
part of the republic where they have
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ions, with atte&#383;tations of their
con&#383;tant re&#383;idence in France, and perhaps &#383;uffer a
thou&#383;and mortifications from the official ignorance and
brutality of the per&#383;ons to whom they apply. No remedy lies
again&#383;t the authors of the&#383;e vexations, and the
&#383;ufferer who is prudent fears even to complain.</p>
<p>I have, in a former letter, noticed the great number of beggars
that &#383;warm at Arras: they are not le&#383;s numerous at
Amiens, though of a different de&#383;cription&mdash;they are
neither &#383;o di&#383;gu&#383;ting, nor &#383;o wretched, but are
much more importunate and in&#383;olent&mdash;they plead neither
&#383;ickne&#383;&#383; nor infirmity, and are, for the mo&#383;t
part, able and healthy. How &#383;o many people &#383;hould beg by
profe&#383;&#383;ion in a large manufacturing town, it i&#383;
difficult to conceive; but, whatever may be the cau&#383;e, I am
tempted to believe the effect has &#383;ome influence on the
manners of the inhabitant&#383; of Amiens. I have &#383;een no town
in France &#383;o remarkable for a rude and unfeeling behaviour,
and it is not fanciful to conjecture that the multitude of poor may
tend in part to occa&#383;ion it. The con&#383;tant view of a
&#383;ort of mi&#383;ery that excites little compa&#383;&#383;ion,
of an intru&#383;ive nece&#383;&#383;ity which one is more
de&#383;irous to repul&#383;e than to relieve, cannot but render
the heart callous, and the manners har&#383;h. The avarice of
commerce, which is here unaccompanied by its liberality, is glad to
confound real di&#383;tre&#383;s with voluntary and idle indigence,
till, in time, an ab&#383;ence of feeling becomes part of the
character; and the con&#383;tant habit of petulant refu&#383;als,
or of acceding more from fatigue than benevolence, has perhaps a
&#383;imilar effect on the voice, ge&#383;ture, and external.</p>
<p>This place has been &#383;o often vi&#383;ited by tho&#383;e who
de&#383;cribe better than my&#383;elf, that I have thought it
unnece&#383;&#383;ary to mention public buildings, or any thing
equally obvious to the traveller or the re&#383;ident. The beauty
and elegance of the cathedral have been celebrated for ages, and I
only remind you of it to indulge my national vanity in the
reflection that one of the mo&#383;t &#383;plendid monuments of
Gothic architecture in France is the work of our Engli&#383;h
ance&#383;tors. The edifice is in perfect pre&#383;ervation, and
the hand of power has not yet ventured to appropriate the plate or
ornaments; but this forbearance will mo&#383;t probably give way to
temptation and impunity. The Convention will re&#383;pect ancient
prejudices no longer than they &#383;uppo&#383;e the people have
courage to defend them, and the latter &#383;eem &#383;o entirely
&#383;ubdued, that, however they may murmur, I do not think any
&#383;erious re&#383;i&#383;tance is to be expected from them, even
in behalf of the relics of St. Firmin. [St. Firmin, the patron of
Amiens, where he is, in many of the &#383;treets, repre&#383;ented
with his head in his hand.]&mdash;The bu&#383;t of Henry the
Fourth, which was a pre&#383;ent from the Monarch him&#383;elf, is
bani&#383;hed the town-hou&#383;e, where it was formerly placed,
though, I hope, &#383;ome royali&#383;t has taken
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of it, and depo&#383;ited it in
&#383;afety till better times. This once popular Prince i&#383; now
a&#383;&#383;ociated with Nero and Caligula, and it is "leze
nation" to &#383;peak of him to a thorough republican.&mdash;I know
not if the French had before the revolution reached the acme of
perfection, but they have certainly been retrograding very
fa&#383;t &#383;ince. Every thing that u&#383;ed to create
fondne&#383;&#383; and veneration is de&#383;pi&#383;ed, and things
are e&#383;teemed only in proportion a&#383; they are
worthle&#383;s. Perhaps the bu&#383;t of Robe&#383;pierre may one
day replace that of Henry the Fourth, and, to &#383;peak in the
&#383;tyle of an ea&#383;tern epi&#383;tle, "what can I &#383;ay
more?"</p>
<p>Should you ever travel this way with Gray in your hand, you will
look for the Ur&#383;uline convent, and regret the paintings he
mentions: but you may recollect, for your con&#383;olation, that
they are merely pretty, and remarkable only for being the work of
one of the nuns.&mdash;Gray, who &#383;eem&#383; to have had that
enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic re&#383;pect for religious orders common to
young minds, admired them on this account; and numbers of
Engli&#383;h travellers have, I dare &#383;ay,
prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed by &#383;uch an authority,
experienced the &#383;ame di&#383;appointment I my&#383;elf felt on
vi&#383;iting the Ur&#383;uline church. Many of the chapels
belonging to the&#383;e communities were very &#383;howy and much
decorated with gilding and &#383;culpture: &#383;ome of them are
&#383;old for a mere trifle, but the greate&#383;t part are filled
with corn and forage, and on the door is in&#383;cribed "Magazin
des armees." The change is almo&#383;t incredible to tho&#383;e who
remember, that le&#383;s than four years ago the Catholic religion
was &#383;trictly practi&#383;ed, and the violation of the&#383;e
&#383;anctuaries deemed &#383;acrilegious. Our great hi&#383;torian
[Gibbon] might well &#383;ay "the influence of
&#383;uper&#383;tition is fluctuating and precarious;" though, in
the pre&#383;ent in&#383;tance, it has rather been re&#383;trained
than &#383;ubdued; and the people, who have not been convinced, but
intimidated, &#383;ecretly lament the&#383;e innovations, and
perhaps reproach them&#383;elves con&#383;cientiou&#383;ly with
their &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<p>Mercier, in his Tableau de Paris, notices, on &#383;everal
occa&#383;ions, the little public &#383;pirit exi&#383;ting among
his countrymen&mdash;it is al&#383;o ob&#383;ervable, that many of
the laws and cu&#383;toms pre&#383;ume on this deficiency, and the
name of republicans has by no means altered that cautiou&#383;
di&#383;po&#383;ition which makes the French con&#383;ider either
mi&#383;fortunes or benefits only as their per&#383;onal
intere&#383;t is affected by them.&mdash;I am ju&#383;t returned
from a vi&#383;it to Abbeville, where we were much alarmed on
Sunday by a fire at the Paraclete convent. The toc&#383;in rang
great part of the day, and the principal &#383;treet of the town
was in danger of being de&#383;troyed. In &#383;uch
circum&#383;tances, you will &#383;uppo&#383;e, that people of all
ranks eagerly crouded to offer their &#383;ervice, and endeavour to
&#383;top the progre&#383;s of &#383;o terrible a calamity. By no
mean&#383;&mdash;the gates of the town were &#383;hut to prevent
its entire evacuation, many hid them&#383;elves in garrets and
cellars, and dragoons patrolled the &#383;treets, and even entered
the hou&#383;es, to force the inhabitants to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t
in procuring water; while the con&#383;ternation, u&#383;ually the
effect of &#383;uch accidents, was only owing to the fear of being
obliged to aid the &#383;ufferers.&mdash;This employment of
military coercion for what humanity alone &#383;hould dictate, is
not a&#383;cribeable to the principles of the pre&#383;ent
government&mdash;it was the &#383;ame before the revolution,
(except that the agents of the ancient &#383;y&#383;tem were not
&#383;o brutal and de&#383;potic as the &#383;oldiers of the
republic,) and compul&#383;ion was always deemed
nece&#383;&#383;ary where there was no &#383;timulant but the
general intere&#383;t.</p>
<p>In England, at any alarm of the fort, all di&#383;tinction of
ranks i&#383; forgotten, and every one is &#383;olicitous to
contribute as much as he i&#383; able to the &#383;afety of his
fellow-citizens; and, &#383;o far from an armed force being
requi&#383;ite to procure a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance, the
greate&#383;t difficulty i&#383; to repre&#383;s the too-officious
zeal of the croud.&mdash;I do not pretend to account for this
national di&#383;parity, but I fear what a French gentleman once
&#383;aid to me of the Pari&#383;ians is applicable to the general
character, <i>"Ils &#383;ont tous egoi&#383;tes,"</i> ["They are
all &#383;elfi&#383;h!"] and they would not do a benevolent action
at the ri&#383;k of &#383;oiling a coat or tearing a ruffle.</p>
<p>Di&#383;tru&#383;t of the a&#383;&#383;ignats, and &#383;carcity
of bread, have occa&#383;ioned a law to oblige the farmers, in
every part of the republic, to &#383;ell their corn at a certain
price, infinitely lower than what they have exacted for &#383;ome
months pa&#383;t. The con&#383;equence of this was, that, on the
&#383;ucceeding market days, no corn came to market, and
detachments of dragoons are obliged to &#383;cour the country to
pre&#383;erve us from a famine. If it did not convey an idea both
of the de&#383;poti&#383;m and want with which the nation is
afflicted, one &#383;hould be amu&#383;ed by the ludicrous figures
of the farmers, who enter the town preceded by &#383;oldiers, and
repo&#383;ing with doleful vi&#383;ages on their &#383;acks of
wheat. Sometimes you &#383;ee a couple of dragoons leading in
triumph an old woman and an a&#383;s, who follow with lingering
&#383;teps their military conductors; and the very a&#383;s
&#383;eems to &#383;ympathize with hi&#383; mi&#383;tre&#383;s on
the di&#383;a&#383;ter of &#383;elling her corn at a reduced price,
and for paper, when &#383;he had hoped to hoard it till a
counter-revolution &#383;hould bring back gold and &#383;ilver.</p>
<p>The farmers are now, perhaps, the greate&#383;t
ari&#383;tocrates in the country; but as both their patrioti&#383;m
and their ari&#383;tocracy have been a mere calculation of
intere&#383;t, the &#383;everity exerci&#383;ed on their avarice is
not much to be regretted. The original fault is, however, in an
u&#383;urped government, which in&#383;pires no confidence, and
which, to &#383;upply an admini&#383;tration lavi&#383;h beyond all
example, has been obliged to i&#383;&#383;ue &#383;uch an
immen&#383;e quantity of paper as nearly de&#383;troys its credit.
In political, as in moral, vices, the fir&#383;t always
nece&#383;&#383;itates a &#383;econd, and the&#383;e mu&#383;t
&#383;till be &#383;u&#383;tained by others; until, at length, the
very &#383;en&#383;e of right and wrong becomes impaired, and the
latter is not only preferred from habit, but from choice.</p>
<p>Thus the arbitrary emi&#383;&#383;ion of paper has been
nece&#383;&#383;arily followed by &#383;till more arbitrary decrees
to &#383;upport it. For in&#383;tance&mdash;the people have been
obliged to &#383;ell their corn at a &#383;tated price, which has
again been the &#383;ource of various and general vexations. The
farmers, irritated by this mea&#383;ure, concealed their grain, or
&#383;old it privately, rather than bring it to
market.&mdash;Hence, &#383;ome were &#383;upplied with bread, and
other&#383; ab&#383;olutely in want of it. This was remedied by the
interference of the military, and a general &#383;earch for corn
has taken place in all hou&#383;e&#383; without exception, in order
to di&#383;cover if any was &#383;ecreted; even our bedchambers
were examined on this occa&#383;ion: but we begin to be &#383;o
accu&#383;tomed to the vi&#383;ite domiciliaire, that we find
our&#383;elves &#383;uddenly &#383;urrounded by the Garde
Nationale, without being greatly alarmed.&mdash;I know not how your
Engli&#383;h patriots, who are &#383;o enamoured of French liberty,
yet thunder with the whole force of their eloquence again&#383;t
the ingre&#383;&#383; of an exci&#383;eman to a tobacco
warehou&#383;e, would reconcile this dome&#383;tic
inqui&#383;ition; for the municipalities here violate your
tranquillity in this manner under any pretext they choo&#383;e, and
that too with an armed cortege &#383;ufficient to undertake the
&#383;iege of your hou&#383;e in form.</p>
<p>About fifteen departments are in in&#383;urrection,
o&#383;ten&#383;ibly in behalf of the expelled Deputies; but I
believe I am authorized in &#383;aying, it is by no means the
de&#383;ire of the people at large to interfere. All who are
capable of reflection con&#383;ider the di&#383;pute merely as a
family quarrel, and are not partial enough to either party to adopt
its cau&#383;e. The tropps they have already rai&#383;ed have been
collected by the per&#383;onal intere&#383;t of the members who
contrived to e&#383;cape, or by an attempt of a few of the
royali&#383;ts to make one half of the faction
&#383;ub&#383;ervient to the de&#383;truction of the other. If you
judge of the principles of the nation by the &#383;ucce&#383;s of
the Foederali&#383;ts,* and the &#383;uperiority of the Convention,
you will be extremely deceived; for it is demon&#383;trable, that
neither the mo&#383;t zealous partizans of the ancient
&#383;y&#383;tem, nor tho&#383;e of the aboli&#383;hed
con&#383;titution, have taken any &#383;hare in the di&#383;pute;
and the departments mo&#383;t notoriou&#383;ly ari&#383;tocratic
have all &#383;ignified their adherence to the proceedings of the
A&#383;&#383;embly.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* On the 31&#383;t of May and 2d of June, the
Convention, who had been for &#383;ome months &#383;truggling with
the Jacobins and the municipality of Paris, was &#383;urrounded by
an armed force: the mo&#383;t moderate of the Deputies (tho&#383;e
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by the name of Bri&#383;&#383;otins,) were
either menaced into a compliance with the mea&#383;ures of the
oppo&#383;ite faction, or arre&#383;ted; others took flight, and,
by repre&#383;enting the violence and &#383;lavery in which the
majority of the Convention wa&#383; holden, excited &#383;ome of
the departments to take arms in their favour.&mdash;This
conte&#383;t, during its &#383;hort exi&#383;tence, was called the
war of the Foederali&#383;ts.&mdash;The re&#383;ult is well
known.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Tho&#383;e who would gladly take an active part in endeavouring
to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a good government, are aver&#383;e from
ri&#383;king their lives and properties in the cau&#383;e of
Bri&#383;&#383;ot or Condorcet.&mdash;At Amiens, where almo&#383;t
every individual is an ari&#383;tocrate, the fugitive Deputies
could not procure the lea&#383;t encouragement, but the town would
have received Dumouriez, and proclaimed the King without
oppo&#383;ition. But this &#383;chi&#383;m in the legi&#383;lature
is con&#383;idered as a mere conte&#383;t of banditti, about the
divi&#383;ion of &#383;poil, not calculated to excite an
intere&#383;t in tho&#383;e they have plundered and
oppre&#383;&#383;ed.</p>
<p>The royali&#383;ts who have been &#383;o mi&#383;taken as to
make any effort on thi&#383; occa&#383;ion, will, I fear, fall a
&#383;acrifice, having acted for the mo&#383;t part without union
or concert; and their junction with the Deputies render&#383; them
&#383;u&#383;picious, if not odious, to their own party. The
extreme difficulty, likewi&#383;e, of communication between the
departments, and the &#383;trict watch ob&#383;erved over all
travellers, form another ob&#383;tacle to the &#383;ucce&#383;s of
any attempt at pre&#383;ent; and, on the whole, the only hope of
deliverance for the French &#383;eems to re&#383;t upon the allied
armies and the in&#383;urgents of La Vendee.</p>
<p>When I &#383;ay this, I do not a&#383;&#383;ert from prejudices,
which often deceive, nor from conjecture, that is always fallible;
but from unexceptionable information&mdash;from an intercour&#383;e
with various ranks of people, and a minute ob&#383;ervance of all.
I have &#383;carcely met with a &#383;ingle per&#383;on who does
not relate the progre&#383;s of the in&#383;urgents in La Vendee
with an air of &#383;ati&#383;faction, or who does not appear to
expect with impatience the &#383;urrender of Conde: and even their
language, perhaps uncon&#383;ciou&#383;ly, betrays their
&#383;entiments, for I remark, they do not, when they &#383;peak of
any victory gained by the arms of the republic, &#383;ay, Nous, or
Notre armee, but, Les Francais, and, Les troupes de la
republique;&mdash;and that always in a tone as though they were
&#383;peaking of an enemy.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h2>June 30, 1793.</h2>
<p>Our modern travellers are mo&#383;tly either &#383;entimental or
philo&#383;ophical, or courtly or political; and I do not remember
to have read any who de&#383;cribe the manner of living among the
gentry and middle ranks of life in France. I will, therefore,
relieve your attention for a moment from our actual
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es, and give you the picture of a day as
u&#383;ually pa&#383;&#383;ed by tho&#383;e who have ea&#383;y
fortunes and no particular employment.&mdash;The &#383;ocial
a&#383;&#383;emblage of a whole family in the morning, as in
England, is not very common, for the French do not generally
breakfa&#383;t: when they do, it i&#383; without form, and on
fruit, bread, wine, and water, or &#383;ometimes coffee; but tea is
&#383;carcely ever u&#383;ed, except by the &#383;ick. The morning
i&#383; therefore pa&#383;&#383;ed with little intercour&#383;e,
and in extreme di&#383;habille. The men loiter, fiddle, work
tape&#383;try, and &#383;ometimes read, in a robe de chambre, or a
jacket and <i>"pantalons;"</i> [Trow&#383;ers.] while the ladies,
equipped only in a &#383;hort manteau and petticoat, vi&#383;it
their birds, knit, or, more frequently, idle away the forenoon
without doing any thing. It is not cu&#383;tomary to walk or make
vi&#383;its before dinner, and if by chance any one calls, he is
received in the bedchamber. At half pa&#383;t one or two they dine,
but without altering the negligence of their apparel, and the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s of the toilette does not begin till immediately
after the repa&#383;t. About four, vi&#383;its of ceremony begin,
and may be made till &#383;ix or &#383;even according to the
&#383;ea&#383;on; but tho&#383;e who intend pa&#383;&#383;ing an
evening at any particular hou&#383;e, go before &#383;ix, and the
card parties generally fini&#383;h between eight and nine. People
then adjourn to their &#383;upper engagements, which are more
common than tho&#383;e for dinner, and are, for the mo&#383;t part,
in different places, and con&#383;idered as a &#383;eparate thing
from the earlier amu&#383;ements of the evening. They keep better
hours than the Engli&#383;h, mo&#383;t families being in bed by
half pa&#383;t ten. The theatre&#383; are al&#383;o regulated by
the&#383;e &#383;ober habits, and the dramatic repre&#383;entations
are u&#383;ually over by nine.</p>
<p>A day pa&#383;&#383;ed in this manner is, as you may imagine,
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of much ennui, and the French are accordingly
more &#383;ubject to it than to any other complaint, and hold it in
greate&#383;t dread than either &#383;ickne&#383;s or
mi&#383;fortune. They have no conception how one can remain two
hours alone without being ennuye a la mort; and but few,
comparatively &#383;peaking, read for amu&#383;ement: you may enter
ten hou&#383;es without &#383;eeing a book; and it is not to be
wondered at that people, who make a point of &#383;taying at home
all the morning, yet do not read, are embarra&#383;&#383;ed with
the di&#383;po&#383;ition of &#383;o much time.&mdash;It is this
that occa&#383;ions &#383;uch a general fondne&#383;s for
dome&#383;tic animals, and &#383;o many barbarous mu&#383;icians,
and male-workers of tape&#383;try and tambour.</p>
<p>I cannot but attribute this littlene&#383;s and di&#383;like of
morning exerci&#383;e to the quantity of animal food the French eat
at night, and to going to re&#383;t immediately after it, in
con&#383;equence of which their activity is checked by
indige&#383;tions, and they feel heavy and uncomfortable for half
the &#383;ucceeding day.&mdash;The French pique them&#383;elves on
being a gayer nation than the Engli&#383;h; but they certainly
mu&#383;t exclude their mornings from the account, for the forlorn
and neglected figure of a Frenchman till dinner is a very antidote
to chearfulne&#383;s, e&#383;pecially if contra&#383;ted with the
animation of our countrymen, who&#383;e forenoon is
pa&#383;&#383;ed in riding or walking, and who make them&#383;elves
at lea&#383;t decent before they appear even in their own
families.</p>
<p>The great difficulty the French have in finding amu&#383;ement
makes them aver&#383;e from long re&#383;idences in the country,
and it is very uncommon for tho&#383;e who can afford only one
hou&#383;e not to prefer a town; but tho&#383;e who&#383;e fortune
will admit of it, live about three months of the year in the
country, and the re&#383;t in the neighbouring town. This, indeed,
as they manage it, is no very con&#383;iderable expence, for the
&#383;ame furniture often &#383;erves for both habitations, and the
one they quit being left empty, requires no per&#383;on to take
charge of it, e&#383;pecially as hou&#383;e-breaking i&#383; very
uncommon in France; at lea&#383;t it was &#383;o before the
revolution, when the police was more &#383;trict, and the laws
again&#383;t robbers were more &#383;evere.</p>
<p>You will &#383;ay, I often de&#383;cribe the habits and manners
of a nation &#383;o frequently vi&#383;ited, as though I were
writing from Kam&#383;chatka or Japan; yet it is certain, as I have
remarked above, that tho&#383;e who are merely itinerant have not
opportunities of ob&#383;erving the modes of familiar life &#383;o
well as one who is &#383;tationary, and travellers are in general
too much occupied by more important ob&#383;ervations to enter into
the minute and trifling details which are the &#383;ubject of my
communications to you. But if your attention be &#383;ometimes
fatigued by occurrences or relations too well known, or of too
little con&#383;equence to be intere&#383;ting, I claim &#383;ome
merit in never having once de&#383;cribed the proportions of a
building, nor given you the hi&#383;tory of a town; and I might
have contrived as well to tax your patience by an erudite
de&#383;cription, as a &#383;uperficial reflection, or a female
remark. The truth is, my pen is generally guided by
circum&#383;tances as they ri&#383;e, and my ideas have &#383;eldom
any deeper origin than the &#383;cene before me. I have no books
here, and I am apt to think if profe&#383;&#383;ed travellers were
deprived of this re&#383;ource, many learned etymologies and much
profound compilation would be lo&#383;t to the modern reader.</p>
<p>The in&#383;urgents of La Vendee continue to have frequent and
decided &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es, but the in&#383;urrections in the
other departments langui&#383;h. The avowed object of liberating
the Convention is not calculated to draw adherents, and if any
better purpo&#383;e be intended, while a faction are the promoters
of it, it will be regarded with too much &#383;u&#383;picion to
procure any effectual movement. Yet, however partial and
unconnected this revolt may be, it is an object of great
jealou&#383;y and inquietude: all the addre&#383;&#383;es or
petitions brought in favour of it are received with
di&#383;approbation, and &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed in the official
bulletin of the legi&#383;lature; but tho&#383;e which expre&#383;s
contrary &#383;entiments are ordered to be in&#383;erted with the
u&#383;ual terms of "applaudi, adopte, et mention
honorable."&mdash;In this manner the army and the people, who
derive their intelligence from the&#383;e accounts (which are
pa&#383;ted up in the &#383;treets,) are kept in ignorance of the
real &#383;tate of di&#383;tant provinces, and, what is &#383;till
more important for the Convention, the communication of examples,
which they know &#383;o many are di&#383;po&#383;ed to imitate, is
retarded.</p>
<p>The people here are nearly in the &#383;ame &#383;tate they have
been in for &#383;ome time&mdash;murmuring in &#383;ecret, and
&#383;ubmitting in public; expecting every thing from that energy
in others which they have not them&#383;elves, and accumulating the
di&#383;contents they are obliged to &#383;uppre&#383;s. The
Convention call them the brave republicans of Amiens; but if their
bravery were as unequivocal as their ari&#383;tocracy, they would
&#383;oon be at the gates of Paris. Even the fir&#383;t levies are
not all departed for the frontiers, and &#383;ome who were
prevailed on to go are already returned.&mdash; All the
nece&#383;&#383;aries of life are augmenting in price&mdash;the
people complain, pillage the &#383;hops and the markets one day,
and want the next. Many of the departments have oppo&#383;ed the
recruiting much more decidedly than they have ventured to do here;
and it was not without in&#383;piring terror by numerous
arre&#383;ts, that the levies which were immediately
nece&#383;&#383;ary were procured.&mdash;France offers no
pro&#383;pect but that of &#383;carcity, di&#383;order, and
oppre&#383;&#383;ion; and my friends begin to perceive that we have
committed an imprudence in remaining &#383;o long. No
pa&#383;&#383;ports can now be obtained, and we mu&#383;t, as well
as &#383;everal very re&#383;pectable families &#383;till here,
abide the event of the war.</p>
<p>Some weeks have elap&#383;ed &#383;ince I had letters from
England, and tho&#383;e we receive from the interior come open, or
&#383;ealed with the &#383;eal of the di&#383;trict. This is not
peculiar to our letters, as being foreigners, but the &#383;ame
unceremonious in&#383;pection is practi&#383;ed with the
corre&#383;pondence of the French them&#383;elves. Thus, in this
land of liberty, all epi&#383;tolary intercour&#383;e has
cea&#383;ed, except for mere matters of bu&#383;ine&#383;s; and
though in the declaration of the rights of man it be
a&#383;&#383;erted, that every one i&#383; entitled to write or
print his thoughts, yet it is certain no per&#383;on can
entru&#383;t a letter to the po&#383;t, but at the ri&#383;k of
having it opened; nor could Mr. Thomas Paine him&#383;elf venture
to expre&#383;s the &#383;lighte&#383;t di&#383;approbation of the
mea&#383;ures of government, without hazarding hi&#383; freedom,
and, in the end, perhaps, his life. Even the&#383;e papers, which I
re&#383;erve only for your amu&#383;ement, which contain only the
opinions of an individual, and which never have been communicated,
I am obliged to conceal with the utmo&#383;t circum&#383;pection;
for &#383;hould they happen to fall into the hands of our
domiciliary inqui&#383;itors, I &#383;hould not, like your
Engli&#383;h liberties, e&#383;cape with the gentle correction of
impri&#383;onment, or the pillory.&mdash;A man, who had murdered
his wife, was lately condemned to twenty years impri&#383;onment
only; but people are guillotined every day for a &#383;imple
di&#383;cour&#383;e, or an inadvertent
expre&#383;&#383;ion.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Amiens, July 5, 1793.</h2>
<p>It will be &#383;ome con&#383;olation to the French, if, from
the wreck of their civil liberty, they be able to pre&#383;erve the
mode of admini&#383;tering ju&#383;tice as e&#383;tabli&#383;hed by
the con&#383;titution of 1789. Were I not warranted by the
be&#383;t information, I &#383;hould not venture an opinion on the
&#383;ubject without much diffidence, but chance has afforded me
opportunities that do not often occur to a &#383;tranger, and the
new code appears to me, in many parts, &#383;ingularly excellent,
both as to principle and practice.&mdash;Ju&#383;tice is here
gratuitou&#383;&mdash;tho&#383;e who admini&#383;ter it are elected
by the people&mdash;they depend only on their &#383;alaries, and
have no fees whatever. Rea&#383;onable allowances are made to
witne&#383;&#383;es both for time and expences at the public
charge&mdash;a lo&#383;s is not doubled by the co&#383;ts of a
pro&#383;ecution to recover it. In ca&#383;es of robbery, where
property found is detained for the &#383;ake of proof, it does not
become the prey of official rapacity, but an ab&#383;olute
re&#383;titution takes place.&mdash;The legi&#383;lature has, in
many re&#383;pects, copied the laws of England, but it has
&#383;implified the forms, and rectified tho&#383;e abu&#383;es
which make our proceedings in &#383;ome ca&#383;es almo&#383;t
a&#383; formidable to the pro&#383;ecutor as to the culprit. Having
to compo&#383;e an entire new &#383;y&#383;tem, and being
un&#383;hackled by profe&#383;&#383;ional reverence for precedents,
they were at liberty to benefit by example, to reject tho&#383;e
errors which have been long &#383;anctioned by their antiquity, and
are &#383;till permitted to exi&#383;t, through our dread of
innovation. The French, however, made an attempt to improve on the
trial by jury, which I think only evinces that the in&#383;titution
as adopted in England is not to be excelled. The deci&#383;ion is
here given by ballot&mdash;unanimity is not required&mdash;and
three white balls are &#383;ufficient to acquit the pri&#383;oner.
This deviation from our mode &#383;eems to give the rich an
advantage over the poor. I fear, that, in the number of twelve men
taken from any country, it may &#383;ometimes happen that three may
be found corruptible: now the wealthy delinquent can avail
him&#383;elf of this human failing; but, "through tatter'd robes
&#383;mall vices do appear," and the indigent &#383;inner has
le&#383;&#383; chance of e&#383;caping than another.</p>
<p>It is to be &#383;uppo&#383;ed, that, at this time, the vigour
of the criminal law&#383; is much relaxed, and their execution
difficult. The army offers refuge and impunity to guilt of all
kinds, and the magi&#383;trates them&#383;elves would be
apprehen&#383;ive of pur&#383;uing an offender who was protected by
the mob, or, which is the &#383;ame thing, by the Jacobins.</p>
<p>The groundwork of much of the French civil juri&#383;prudence is
arbitration, particularly in tho&#383;e trifling
proce&#383;&#383;es which originate in a &#383;pirit of litigation;
and it is not ea&#383;y for a man here, however well
di&#383;po&#383;ed, to &#383;pend twenty pounds in a conte&#383;t
about as many pence, or to ruin him&#383;elf in order to
&#383;ecure the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of half an acre of
land. In general, redre&#383;s is ea&#383;ily obtained without
unnece&#383;&#383;ary procra&#383;tination, and with little or no
co&#383;t. Perhaps mo&#383;t legal codes may be &#383;imple and
efficacious at their fir&#383;t in&#383;titution, and the
circum&#383;tance of their being encumbered with forms which render
them complex and expen&#383;ive, may be the natural
con&#383;equence of length of time and change of manners. Littleton
might require no commentary in the reign of Henry II. and the
my&#383;terious fictions that con&#383;titute the &#383;cience of
modern judicature were perhaps familiar, and even
nece&#383;&#383;ary, to our ance&#383;tors. It is to be regretted
that we cannot adapt our laws to the age in which we live, and
a&#383;&#383;imilate them to our cu&#383;toms; but the tendency of
our nature to extremes perpetuates evils, and makes both the
wi&#383;e and the timid enemie&#383; to reform. We fear, like John
Calvin, to tear the habit while we are &#383;tripping off the
&#383;uperfluous decoration; and the example of this country will
probably long act as a di&#383;couragement to all change, either
judicial or political. The very name of France will repre&#383;s
the de&#383;ire of innovation&mdash;we &#383;hall cling to
abu&#383;es as though they were our &#383;upport, and every attempt
to remedy them will become an objection of &#383;u&#383;picion and
terror.&mdash;Such are the advantages which mankind will derive
from the French revolution.</p>
<p>The Jacobin con&#383;titution is now fini&#383;hed, and, as far
as I am able to judge, it is what might be expected from &#383;uch
an origin: calculated to flatter the people with an imaginary
&#383;overeignty&mdash;to place the whole power of election in the
cla&#383;s mo&#383;t ea&#383;ily mi&#383;led&mdash;to exclude from
the repre&#383;entation tho&#383;e who have a natural intere&#383;t
in the welfare of the country, and to e&#383;tabli&#383;h the reign
of anarchy and intrigue.&mdash;Yet, however aver&#383;e the greater
number of the French may be from &#383;uch a con&#383;titution, no
town or di&#383;trict has dared to reject it; and I remark, that
among&#383;t tho&#383;e who have been foremo&#383;t in offering
their acceptation, are many of the places mo&#383;t
notoriou&#383;ly ari&#383;tocratic. I have enquired of &#383;ome of
the inhabitants of the&#383;e very zealous towns on what principle
they acted &#383;o much in oppo&#383;ition to their known
&#383;entiments: the reply i&#383; always, that they fear the
vengeance of the Jacobins, and that they are awed by military
force. This rea&#383;oning is, of cour&#383;e, unan&#383;werable;
and we learn, from the debates of the Convention, that the people
have received the new con&#383;titution <i>"avec la plus vive
reconnoi&#383;&#383;ance,"</i> ["With the mo&#383;t lively
gratitude."] and that they have all &#383;worn to die in its
defence.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>July 14, 1793.</h2>
<p>The return of this day cannot but &#383;ugge&#383;t very
melancholy reflections to all who are witne&#383;&#383;es of the
changes which a &#383;ingle year has produced. In twelve months
only the government of France has been overturned, her commerce
de&#383;troyed, the country depopulated to rai&#383;e armies, and
the people deprived of bread to &#383;upport them. A
de&#383;poti&#383;m more ab&#383;olute than that of Turkey is
e&#383;tabli&#383;hed, the manners of the nation are corrupted, and
its moral character is di&#383;graced in the eyes of all Europe. A
barbarous rage has laid wa&#383;te the faire&#383;t monuments of
art&mdash;whatever could embelli&#383;h &#383;ociety, or contribute
to &#383;often exi&#383;tence, ha&#383; di&#383;appeared under the
reign of the&#383;e modern Goth&#383;&mdash;even the
nece&#383;&#383;arie&#383; of life are becoming rare and inadequate
to the con&#383;umption&mdash;the rich are plundered and
per&#383;ecuted, yet the poor are in want&mdash;the national credit
is in the la&#383;t &#383;tage of deba&#383;ement, yet an
immen&#383;e debt is created, and daily accumulating; and
apprehen&#383;ion, di&#383;tru&#383;t, and mi&#383;ery, are
almo&#383;t univer&#383;al.&mdash;All this is the work of a
&#383;et of adventurers who are now divided among
them&#383;elve&#383;&mdash;who are accu&#383;ing each other of
tho&#383;e crime&#383; which the world imputes to them
all&mdash;and who, con&#383;cious they can no longer deceive the
nation, now govern with the fear and &#383;u&#383;picion of
tyrants. Every thing is &#383;acrificed to the army and Paris, and
the people are robbed of their &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence to
&#383;upply an iniquitous metropolis, and a military force that
awes and oppre&#383;&#383;es them.</p>
<p>The new con&#383;titution has been received here officially, but
no one &#383;eem&#383; to take the lea&#383;t intere&#383;t in it:
it is regarded in ju&#383;t the &#383;ame light as a new tax, or
any other mini&#383;terial mandate, not &#383;ent to be
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed but obeyed. The mode of proclaiming it
conveyed a very ju&#383;t idea of it&#383; origin and tendency. It
was placed on a cu&#383;hion, &#383;upported by Jacobin&#383; in
their red caps, and &#383;urrounded by dragoons. It &#383;eemed the
image of Anarchy, guarded by De&#383;poti&#383;m.&mdash;In this
manner they paraded the town, and the "&#383;acred volume" was then
depo&#383;ed on an altar erected on the Grande Place.&mdash;The
Garde Nationale, who were ordered to be under arms, attended, and
the con&#383;titution was read. A few of the &#383;oldiers cried
"Vive la republique!" and every one returned home with countenances
in which delight was by no means the prevailing
expre&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>A trifling incident which I noticed on this occa&#383;ion, will
&#383;erve, among others of the &#383;ame kind that I could
enumerate, to prove that even the very lower cla&#383;s of the
people begin to ridicule and de&#383;pi&#383;e their
legi&#383;lators. While a municipal officer was very gravely
reading the con&#383;titution, an a&#383;s forced his way
acro&#383;s the &#383;quare, and placed him&#383;elf near the
&#383;pot where the ceremony was performing: a boy, who was under
our window, on ob&#383;erving it, cried out, "Why don't they give
him the <i>accolade fraternelle!"</i>*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Fraternal embrace.&mdash;This is the reception given
by the Pre&#383;ident to any one whom the Convention wi&#383;h
particularly to di&#383;tingui&#383;h. On an occa&#383;ion of the
&#383;ort, the fraternal embrace was given to an old
Negre&#383;s.&mdash;The honours of the fitting are al&#383;o daily
accorded to deputations of fi&#383;h-women, chimney-&#383;weepers,
children, and all who&#383;e mi&#383;&#383;ions are flattering.
There is no homage &#383;o mean as not to gratify the pride of
tho&#383;e to whom dominion is new; and the&#383;e
expre&#383;&#383;ions are &#383;o often and &#383;o &#383;trangely
applied, that it is not &#383;urprizing they are become the cant
phra&#383;es of the mob.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"Yes, (rejoined another,) and admit him <i>aux honneurs
de la feance."</i> [To the honours of the fitting.] This
di&#383;po&#383;ition to je&#383;t with their mi&#383;fortunes is,
however, not &#383;o common as it was formerly. A bon mot may
alleviate the lo&#383;s of a battle, and a lampoon on the court
&#383;olace under the burthen of a new impo&#383;t; but the
mo&#383;t thoughtle&#383;s or improvident can find nothing very
facetious in the pro&#383;pect of ab&#383;olute want&mdash;and
tho&#383;e who have been u&#383;ed to laugh under a
circum&#383;cription of their political liberty, feel very
&#383;eriou&#383;ly the evil of a government which endows it&#383;
members with unlimited power, and enables a Deputy, often the
meane&#383;t and mo&#383;t profligate character of his department,
to impri&#383;on all who, from caprice, intere&#383;t, or
vengeance, may have become the objects of hi&#383;
per&#383;ecution.</p>
<p>I know this will appear &#383;o mon&#383;trous to an
Engli&#383;hman, that, had I an opportunity of communicating
&#383;uch a circum&#383;tance before it were publicly
authenticated, you would &#383;uppo&#383;e it impo&#383;&#383;ible,
and imagine I had been mi&#383;taken, or had written only from
report; it is neverthele&#383;s true, that every part of France is
infe&#383;ted by the&#383;e Commi&#383;&#383;ioners, who
di&#383;po&#383;e, without appeal, of the freedom and property of
the whole department to which they are &#383;ent. It frequently
happens, that men are delegated to places where they have
re&#383;ided, and thus have an opportunity of gratifying their
per&#383;onal malice on all who are &#383;o unfortunate as to be
obnoxious to them. Imagine, for a moment, a village-attorney acting
with uncontrouled authority over the country where he formerly
exerci&#383;ed hi&#383; profe&#383;&#383;ion, and you will have
&#383;ome idea of what pa&#383;&#383;es here, except that I hope no
cla&#383;s of men in England are &#383;o bad as tho&#383;e which
compo&#383;e the major part of the National
Convention.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>July 23, 1793.</h2>
<p>The events of Paris which are any way remarkable are &#383;o
generally circulated, that I do not often mention them, unle&#383;s
to mark their effect on the provinces; but you will be &#383;o much
mi&#383;led by the public paper&#383; with regard to the death of
Marat, that I think it nece&#383;&#383;ary to notice the
&#383;ubject while it is yet recent in my memory. Were the clubs,
the Convention, or the &#383;ections of Paris to be regarded as
expre&#383;&#383;ing the &#383;en&#383;e of the people, the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination of this turbulent journali&#383;t
mu&#383;t be con&#383;idered being the ca&#383;e, that the
departments are for the mo&#383;t part, if not rejoiced,
indifferent&mdash;and many of tho&#383;e who impute to him the
honour of martyrdom, or a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t at his
apotheo&#383;is, are much better &#383;ati&#383;fied both with his
chri&#383;tian and heathen glories, than they were while he was
living to propagate anarchy and pillage. The reverence of the
Convention it&#383;elf is a mere political pantomime. Within the
la&#383;t twelve months nearly all the individuals who compo&#383;e
it have treated Marat with contempt; and I perfectly remember even
Danton, one of the members of the Committee of Salut Publique,
accu&#383;ing him of being a contre revolutionnaire.</p>
<p>But the people, to u&#383;e a popular expre&#383;&#383;ion here,
require to be electrified.&mdash;St. Fargeau is almo&#383;t
forgotten, and Marat is to &#383;erve the &#383;ame purpo&#383;es
when dead, to which he contributed while living.&mdash;An extreme
gro&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s and want of feeling form the
characteri&#383;tic feature of the Pari&#383;ians; they are
ignorant, credulous, and material, and the Convention do not fail
on all occa&#383;ions to avail them&#383;elves of the&#383;e
qualities. The corp&#383;e of Marat decently enclo&#383;ed in a
coffin would have made little impre&#383;&#383;ion, and it was not
pity, but revenge, which was to be excited. The
di&#383;gu&#383;ting object of a dead leper was therefore
expo&#383;ed to the eyes of a metropolis calling it&#383;elf the
mo&#383;t refined and enlightened of all Europe&mdash;</p>

</pre></td>

</center>
<p>I know not whether the&#383;e lines are mo&#383;t applicable to
the di&#383;play of Marat's body, or the con&#383;ecration of his
fame, but both will be a la&#383;ting &#383;tigma on the manners
and morals of Paris.</p>
<p>If the departments, however, take no intere&#383;t in the
lo&#383;s of Marat, the young woman who
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inated him has created a very lively one.
The &#383;lighte&#383;t anecdotes concerning her are collected with
avidity, and repeated with admiration; and this is a &#383;till
farther proof of what you have heard me advance, that neither
patrioti&#383;m nor humanity has an abundant growth in this
country. The French applaud an act in it&#383;elf horrid and
unju&#383;tifiable, while they have &#383;carcely any conception of
the motive, and &#383;uch a &#383;acrifice &#383;eems to them
&#383;omething &#383;upernatural.&mdash;The Jacobins
a&#383;&#383;ert, that Charlotte Corday was an emi&#383;&#383;ary
of the allied powers, or, rather, of Mr. Pitt; and the
Pari&#383;ians have the complai&#383;ance to believe, that a young
woman could devote her&#383;elf to certain de&#383;truction at the
in&#383;tigation of another, as though the &#383;ame
principle&#383; which would lead a per&#383;on to undertake a
diplomatic commi&#383;&#383;ion, would induce her to meet
death.</p>
<p>I wrote &#383;ome days ago to a lady of my acquaintance at Caen,
to beg &#383;he would procure me &#383;ome information relative to
this extraordinary female, and I &#383;ubjoin an extract of her
an&#383;wer, which I have ju&#383;t received:</p>
<p>"Mi&#383;s Corday was a native of this department, and had, from
her earlie&#383;t years, been very carefully educated by an aunt
who lives at Caen. Before &#383;he was twenty &#383;he had decided
on taking the veil, and her noviciate wa&#383; ju&#383;t expired
when the Con&#383;tituent A&#383;&#383;embly interdicted all
religious vow&#383; for the future: &#383;he then left the convent,
and re&#383;ided entirely with her aunt. The beauty of her
per&#383;on, and particularly her mental acqui&#383;itions, which
were &#383;uperior to that of French women in general, rendered an
object of much admiration. She &#383;poke uncommonly well, and her
di&#383;cour&#383;e often turned on the ancients, and on &#383;uch
&#383;ubjects a&#383; indicated that ma&#383;culine turn of mind
which has &#383;ince proved &#383;o fatal to her. Perhaps her
conver&#383;ation was a little tinctured with that pedantry not
unju&#383;tly attributed to our &#383;ex when they have a little
more knowledge than u&#383;ual, but, at the &#383;ame time, not in
&#383;uch a degree as to render it unplea&#383;ant. She &#383;eldom
gave any opinion on the revolution, but frequently attended the
municipalities to &#383;olicit the pen&#383;ions of the expelled
religious, or on any other occa&#383;ion where &#383;he could be
u&#383;eful to her friends. On the arrival of Petion, Barbaroux,
and others of the Bri&#383;&#383;otin faction, &#383;he began to
frequent the clubs, and to take a more lively intere&#383;t in
political affairs. Petion, and Barbaroux e&#383;pecially,
&#383;eemed to be much re&#383;pected by her. It was even
&#383;aid, &#383;he had a tender partiality for the latter; but
this I believe is untrue.&mdash;I dined with her at her aunt's on
the Sunday previous to her departure for Paris. Nothing very
remarkable appeared in her behaviour, except that &#383;he wa&#383;
much affected by a mu&#383;ter of the recruits who were to march
again&#383;t Paris, and &#383;eemed to think many lives might be
lo&#383;t on the occa&#383;ion, without obtaining any relief for
the country.&mdash;On the Tue&#383;day following &#383;he left
Caen, under pretext of vi&#383;iting her father, who lives at Sens.
Her aunt accompanied her to the gate of the town, and the
&#383;eparation wa&#383; extremely &#383;orrowful on both
&#383;ides. The &#383;ub&#383;equent events are too well known to
need recital."</p>
<p>On her trial, and at her execution, Mi&#383;s Corday was firm
and mode&#383;t; and I have been told, that in her la&#383;t
moments her whole figure wa&#383; intere&#383;ting beyond
de&#383;cription. She was tall, well formed, and
beautiful&mdash;her eyes, e&#383;pecially, were fine and
expre&#383;&#383;ive&mdash;even her dre&#383;&#383; was not
neglected, and a &#383;imple white di&#383;habille added to the
charms of this &#383;elf-devoted victim. On the whole, it is not
po&#383;&#383;ible to a&#383;certain preci&#383;ely the motives
which determined her to a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inate Marat. Her
letter to Barbaroux expre&#383;&#383;es nothing but republican
&#383;entiments; yet it is difficult to conceive that a young
woman, who had voluntarily embraced the life of a cloi&#383;ter,
could be really of this way of thinking.&mdash;I cannot but
&#383;uppo&#383;e her connection with the Deputies aro&#383;e
merely from an idea that they might be the in&#383;truments of
re&#383;toring the aboli&#383;hed government, and her
profe&#383;&#383;ion of republican principles after &#383;he
wa&#383; arre&#383;ted might probably be with a view of &#383;aving
Duperret, and others of the party, who were &#383;till in the power
of the Convention.&mdash;Her &#383;election of Marat &#383;till
remains to be accounted for. He was, indeed, the mo&#383;t violent
of the Jacobins, but not the mo&#383;t dangerous, and the death of
&#383;everal others might have been more &#383;erviceable to the
cau&#383;e. Marat was, however, the avowed per&#383;ecutor of
prie&#383;ts and religion, and if we attribute any influence to
Mi&#383;s Corday's former habits, we may &#383;uppo&#383;e them to
have had &#383;ome &#383;hare in the choice of her victim. Her
refu&#383;al of the mini&#383;try of a con&#383;titutional
prie&#383;t at the &#383;caffold &#383;trengthens thi&#383;
opinion. We pay a kind of involuntary tribute of admiration to
&#383;uch firmne&#383;s of mind in a young and beautiful woman; and
I do not recollect that hi&#383;tory has tran&#383;mitted any thing
parallel to the heroi&#383;m of Charlotte Corday. Love, revenge,
and ambition, have often &#383;acrificed their victims, and
&#383;u&#383;tained the courage of their voluntaries under
puni&#383;hment; but a female, animated by no per&#383;onal
motives, &#383;en&#383;ible only to the mi&#383;fortunes of her
country, patriotic both from feeling and reflection, and
&#383;acrificing her&#383;elf from principle, is &#383;ingular in
the annals of human nature.&mdash;Yet, after doing ju&#383;tice to
&#383;uch an in&#383;tance of fortitude and philanthropic devotion,
I cannot but &#383;incerely lament the act to which it has given
ri&#383;e. At a time when &#383;o many &#383;pirits are irritated
by de&#383;pair and oppre&#383;&#383;ion, the example may be highly
pernicious, and a cau&#383;e, however good, mu&#383;t always be
injured by the u&#383;e of &#383;uch means in its
&#383;upport.&mdash;Nothing can &#383;anctify an
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination; and were not the French more
vindictive than humane, the crimes of the republican party would
find a momentary refuge in this injudicious effort to puni&#383;h
them.</p>
<p>My friend La Marqui&#383;e de ____ has left Paris, and is now at
Peronne, where &#383;he has engaged me to pa&#383;s a few weeks
with her; &#383;o that my next will mo&#383;t probably be dated
from thence.&mdash;Mr. D____ is endeavouring to get a
pa&#383;&#383;port for England. He begins to regret having remained
here. His temper, naturally impatient of re&#383;traint, accords
but ill with the portion of liberty enjoyed by our republicans.
Corporal privations and mental interdictions multiply &#383;o
fa&#383;t, that irritable people like him&#383;elf, and
valetudinarians like Mrs. C____ and me, could not choo&#383;e a
wor&#383;e re&#383;idence; and, as we are now unanimous on the
&#383;ubject, I hope &#383;oon to leave the country.&mdash;There
is, as you ob&#383;erve in your la&#383;t, &#383;omething of
indolence as well as friend&#383;hip in my having &#383;o long
remained here; but if actions were always analyzed &#383;o
&#383;trictly, and we were not allowed to derive a little credit
from our weakne&#383;&#383;es, how many great character&#383; would
be reduced to the common level. Voltaire introduced a &#383;ort of
rage for anecdotes, and for tracing all events to trifling
cau&#383;es, which ha&#383; done much more towards exploding the
old-fa&#383;hioned &#383;y&#383;tem or the dignity of human nature
than the dry maxims of Rochefaucault, the &#383;ophi&#383;ms of
Mandeville, or even the malicious wit of Swift. This is al&#383;o
another effect of the progre&#383;s of philo&#383;ophy; and this
&#383;ort of moral Quixoti&#383;m, continually in &#383;earch of
evil, and more gratified in di&#383;covering it than pained by its
exi&#383;tence, may be very philo&#383;ophical; but it is at
lea&#383;t gloomy and di&#383;couraging; and we may be permitted to
doubt whether mankind become wi&#383;er or better by learning, that
tho&#383;e who have been mo&#383;t remarkable either for
wi&#383;dom or virtue were occa&#383;ionally under the influence of
the &#383;ame follies and pa&#383;&#383;ions as other
people.&mdash;Your uncharitable di&#383;cernment, you &#383;ee, has
led me into a digre&#383;&#383;ion, and I have, without intending
it, connected the motives of my &#383;tay with reflections on
Voltaire's General Hi&#383;tory, Barillon's Letters, and all the
&#383;ecret biography of our modern libraries. This, you will
&#383;ay, i&#383; only a chapter of a "man's importance to
him&#383;elf;" but public affairs are now &#383;o confu&#383;ed and
di&#383;gu&#383;ting, that we are glad to encourage any train of
ideas not a&#383;&#383;ociated with them.</p>
<p>The Commi&#383;&#383;ioners I gave you &#383;ome account of in a
former letter are departed, and we have lately had Chabot, an
Ex-capuchin, and a patriot of &#383;pecial note in the Convention,
and one Dumont, an attorney of a neighbouring village. They are,
like all the re&#383;t of the&#383;e mi&#383;&#383;ionaries,
entru&#383;ted with unlimited powers, and in&#383;pire
apprehen&#383;ion and di&#383;may wherever they approach.</p>
<p>The Garde Nationale of Amiens are not yet entirely &#383;ubdued
to the times, and Chabot gave &#383;ome hints of a project to
di&#383;arm them, and actually attempted to arre&#383;t &#383;ome
of their officers; but, apprized of his de&#383;ign, they remained
two nights under arms, and the Capuchin, who is not martially
inclined, was &#383;o alarmed at this indication of
re&#383;i&#383;tance, that he has left the town with more
ha&#383;te than ceremony.&mdash;He had, in an harangue at the
cathedral, inculcated &#383;ome very edifying doctrines on the
divi&#383;ion of property and the right of pillage; and it is not
improbable, had he not withdrawn, but the Amienois would have
ventured, on thi&#383; pretext, to arre&#383;t him. Some of them
contrived, in &#383;pite of the centinel placed at the lodging of
the&#383;e great men, to pa&#383;te up on the door two figures,
with the names of Chabot and Dumont; in the "fatal po&#383;ition of
the unfortunate brave;" and though certain events in the lives of
the&#383;e Deputies may have rendered this per&#383;pective of
their la&#383;t moments not ab&#383;olutely a novelty, yet I do not
recollect that Aken&#383;ide, or any other author, has enumerated a
gibbet among&#383;t the objects, which, though not agreeable in
them&#383;elves, may be reconciled to the mind by familiarity. I
wi&#383;h, therefore, our repre&#383;entatives may not, in return
for thi&#383; admonitory portrait of their latter end, draw down
&#383;ome vengeance on the town, not ea&#383;ily to be
appea&#383;ed. I am no a&#383;trologer, but in our &#383;ublunary
world the conjunction of an attorney and a renegade monk cannot
pre&#383;ent a fortunate a&#383;pect; and I am truly anxious to
find my&#383;elf once again under the more benign influence of your
Engli&#383;h hemi&#383;phere.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Peronne, July 29, 1793.</h2>
<p>Every attempt to obtain pa&#383;&#383;ports has been
fruitle&#383;s, and, with that &#383;ort of di&#383;contented
re&#383;ignation which is the effect of nece&#383;&#383;ity, I now
look upon my&#383;elf as fixed here till the peace. I left Mr. and
Mrs. D____ ye&#383;terday morning, the di&#383;appointment
operating upon them in full force. The former takes longer walks
than u&#383;ual, breaks out in philippic&#383; again&#383;t
tyrannies of all kinds, and &#383;wears ten times a day that the
French are the mo&#383;t noi&#383;y people upon earth&mdash;the
latter is vexed, and, for that rea&#383;on, fancies &#383;he is
ill, and calculates, with great ingenuity, all the hazard and
inconvenience we may be liable to by remaining here. I hope, on my
return, to find them more reconciled.</p>
<p>At Villars de Bretonne, on my road hither, &#383;ome people told
me, with great gaiety, that the Engli&#383;h had made a
de&#383;cent on the coa&#383;t of Picardy. Such a report (for I did
not &#383;uppo&#383;e it po&#383;&#383;ible) during the la&#383;t
war would have made me tremble, but I heard this without alarm,
having, in no in&#383;tance, &#383;een the people take that kind of
intere&#383;t in public events which formerly made a re&#383;idence
in France unplea&#383;ant to an individual of an ho&#383;tile
nation. It is not that they are become more liberal, or better
informed&mdash;no change of this kind has been di&#383;covered even
by the warme&#383;t advocates of the revolution; but they are more
indifferent, and tho&#383;e who are not decidedly the enemies of
the pre&#383;ent government, for the mo&#383;t part concern
them&#383;elves as little about the events of the war, as though it
were carried on in the South Sea.</p>
<p>I fear I &#383;hould ri&#383;k an imputation on my veracity,
were I to de&#383;cribe the extreme ignorance and inattention of
the French with re&#383;pect to public men and mea&#383;ures. They
draw no conclu&#383;ions from the pa&#383;t, form no conjectures
for the future, and, after exclaiming "Il ne peut pas durer comme
cela," they, with a re&#383;ignation which is certainly neither
piou&#383; nor philo&#383;ophic, leave the re&#383;t to the agency
of Providence.&mdash;Even tho&#383;e who are more informed &#383;o
bewilder them&#383;elves in the politics of Greece and Rome, that
they do not perceive how little the&#383;e are applicable to their
own country. Indeed, it &#383;hould &#383;eem that no modern age or
people is worthy the knowledge of a Frenchman.&mdash;I have often
remarked, in the cour&#383;e of our corre&#383;pondence, how little
they are acquainted with what regards England or the Engli&#383;h;
and &#383;carcely a day pa&#383;&#383;es that I have not
occa&#383;ion to make the &#383;ame ob&#383;ervation.</p>
<p>My conductor hither, who is a friend of Mad. de T____, and
e&#383;teemed "bien in&#383;truit," was much &#383;urprized when I
told him that the population and &#383;ize of London exceeded that
of Pari&#383;&mdash;that we had good fruit, and better vegetables
than were to be found in many parts of France. I &#383;aw that he
&#383;u&#383;pected my veracity, and there is always on the&#383;e
occa&#383;ions &#383;uch a decided and impenetrable incredulity in
a Frenchman as precludes all hopes of convincing him. He
li&#383;tens with a &#383;ort of &#383;elf-&#383;ufficient
complacence which tells you he does not con&#383;ider your
a&#383;&#383;ertions as any thing more than the exaggerations of
national vanity, but that hi&#383; politene&#383;s does not allow
him to contradict you. I know nothing more di&#383;gu&#383;tingly
impertinent than his ignorance, which intrenches it&#383;elf behind
the forms of civility, and, affecting to decline controver&#383;y,
a&#383;&#383;umes the merit of forbearance and moderation: yet this
mu&#383;t have been often ob&#383;erved by every one who has lived
much in French &#383;ociety: for the fir&#383;t emotion of a
Frenchman, on hearing any thing which tends to place another
country on an equality with France, is doubt&mdash;this doubt
i&#383; in&#383;tantly reinforced by vanity&mdash;and, in a few
&#383;econds, he is perfectly &#383;ati&#383;fied that the thing is
impo&#383;&#383;ible.</p>
<p>One mu&#383;t be captious indeed to object to this, did it
ari&#383;e from that patriotic feeling &#383;o common in the
Engli&#383;h; but here it is all vanity, downright vanity: a
Frenchman mu&#383;t have his country and his
mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383; admired, though he does not often care much
for either one or the other. I have been in various parts of France
in the mo&#383;t critical periods of the revolution&mdash;I have
conver&#383;ed with people of all parties and of all
rank&#383;&mdash;and I a&#383;&#383;ert, that I have never yet met
but with one man who had a grain of real patrioti&#383;m. If the
Athenian law were adopted which doomed all to death who &#383;hould
be indifferent to the public welfare in a time of danger, I fear
there would be a woeful depopulation here, even among the
loude&#383;t champions of democracy.</p>
<p>It is not thirty miles from Amiens to Peronne, yet a journey of
thirty miles is not now to be undertaken incon&#383;iderately; the
hor&#383;es are &#383;o much worked, and &#383;o ill fed, that few
perform &#383;uch a di&#383;tance without re&#383;t and management.
If you wi&#383;h to take others, and continue your route, you
cannot, or if you wait while your own hor&#383;es are
refre&#383;hed, as a reward for your humanity you get &#383;tarved
your&#383;elf. Bread being very &#383;carce, no family can get more
than &#383;ufficient for its own con&#383;umption, and tho&#383;e
who travel without fir&#383;t &#383;upplying them&#383;elves, do it
at the ri&#383;k of finding none on the road.</p>
<p>Peronne is chiefly remarkable in hi&#383;tory for never having
been taken, and for a tower where Louis XI. was confined for a
&#383;hort time, after being outwitted in a manner &#383;omewhat
&#383;urprizing for a Monarch who piqued him&#383;elf on his
talents for intrigue, by Charles le Temeraire, Duke of Burgundy. It
modern reputation, ari&#383;es from its election of the Abbe Maury
for its repre&#383;entative, and for entertaining political
principle&#383; every way analogous to &#383;uch a choice.</p>
<p>I found the Marqui&#383;e much altered in her per&#383;on, and
her health much impaired, by the frequent alarms and continual
apprehen&#383;ions &#383;he had been &#383;ubject to at Paris.
Fortunately &#383;he has no imputation again&#383;t her but her
rank and fortune, for &#383;he is utterly guiltle&#383;s of all
political opinions; &#383;o that I hope &#383;he will be
&#383;uffered to knit &#383;tockings, tend her birds and dogs, and
read romances in peace.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Augu&#383;t 1, 1793.</h2>
<p>When the creation of a&#383;&#383;ignats was fir&#383;t
propo&#383;ed, much ingenuity wa&#383; employed in conjecturing,
and much eloquence di&#383;played in expatiating upon, the various
evils that might re&#383;ult from them; yet the genius of party,
however u&#383;ually &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful in gloomy
per&#383;pective, did not at that time imagine half the
inconvenience this mea&#383;ure was fraught with. It was ea&#383;y,
indeed, to fore&#383;ee, that an immen&#383;e circulation of paper,
like any other currency, mu&#383;t augment the price of every
thing; but the exce&#383;&#383;ive di&#383;credit of the
a&#383;&#383;ignats, operating acce&#383;&#383;arily to their
quantity, has produced a train of collateral effects of greater
magnitude than even tho&#383;e that were originally apprehended.
Within the la&#383;t twelve months the whole country are become
monopolizer&#383;&mdash;the de&#383;ire of realizing has &#383;o
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed all degrees of people, that there is
&#383;carcely an article of con&#383;umption which is not bought up
and &#383;ecreted. One would really &#383;uppo&#383;e that nothing
was peri&#383;hable but the national credit&mdash;the nobleman, the
merchant, the &#383;hopkeeper, all who have a&#383;&#383;ignats,
engage in the&#383;e &#383;peculations, and the
nece&#383;&#383;ities of our di&#383;&#383;ipated heirs do not
drive them to re&#383;ources for obtaining money more
whim&#383;ical than the commerce now practi&#383;ed here to get rid
of it. I know a beau who ha&#383; converted his <i>hypotheque</i>
[Mortgage.] on the national domains into train oil, and a General
who has given the&#383;e "airy nothing&#383;" the
&#383;ub&#383;tance and form of hemp and leather!*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* In the late rage for monopolies in France, a
per&#383;on who had ob&#383;erved the va&#383;t daily
con&#383;umption of onions, garlic, and e&#383;chalots, conceived
the project of making the whole di&#383;trict of Amiens tributary
for this indi&#383;pen&#383;ible article. In con&#383;equence, he
attended &#383;everal market-days, and purcha&#383;ed all that came
in hi&#383; way. The country people finding a ready &#383;ale for
their onions, poured in from all quarters, and our projector found
that, in proportion as he bought, the market became more
profu&#383;ely &#383;upplied, and that the commodity he had hoped
to monopolize was inexhau&#383;tible.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Goods purcha&#383;ed from &#383;uch motives are not as you may
conceive &#383;old till the temptation of an exorbitant profit
&#383;educes the proprietor to ri&#383;k a momentary
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of a&#383;&#383;ignats, which are
again di&#383;po&#383;ed of in a &#383;imilar way. Thus many
nece&#383;&#383;aries of life are withdrawn from circulation, and
when a real &#383;carcity en&#383;ues, they are produced to the
people, charged with all the accumulated gains of the&#383;e
intermediate barters.</p>
<p>This illiberal and pernicious commerce, which avarice and fear
have for &#383;ome time kept in great activity, has at length
attracted the notice of the Convention, and very &#383;evere laws
are now enacted again&#383;t monopolie&#383; of all kinds. The
holder of any quantity of merchandize beyond what he may be
&#383;uppo&#383;ed to con&#383;ume is obliged to declare it to his
municipality, and to expo&#383;e the articles he deals in in
writing over his door. The&#383;e clau&#383;es, as well as every
other part of the decree, &#383;eem very wi&#383;e and equitable;
but I doubt if the &#383;everity of the puni&#383;hment annexed to
any tran&#383;gre&#383;&#383;ion of it will not operate &#383;o as
to defeat the purpo&#383;e&#383; intended to be produced. A
fal&#383;e declaration is puni&#383;hable by &#383;ix year&#383;
impri&#383;onment, and an ab&#383;olute non-compliance with
death.&mdash;Black&#383;tone remarks, that it is the certainty, not
the &#383;everity, of puni&#383;hment, which makes laws
efficacious; and this mu&#383;t ever be the ca&#383;e among&#383;t
an humane people.&mdash;An inordinate de&#383;ire of gain is not
often con&#383;idered by mankind as very criminal, and tho&#383;e
who would willingly &#383;ubject it to it&#383; adequate
puni&#383;hment of fine and confi&#383;cation, will he&#383;itate
to become the means of inflicting death on the offender, or of
depriving him of hi&#383; liberty. The Poets have, from time
immemorial, claimed a kind of exclu&#383;ive juri&#383;diction over
the &#383;in of avarice: but, unfortunately, mind&#383; once
&#383;teeled by this vice are not often &#383;en&#383;ible to the
attacks of ridicule; and I have never heard that any poet, from
Plautus to Moliere, has reformed a &#383;ingle mi&#383;er. I am
not, therefore, &#383;orry that our legi&#383;lature has encroached
on this branch of the poetical prerogative, and only wi&#383;h that
the mild regimen of the Mu&#383;es had been &#383;ucceeded by
&#383;omething le&#383;s rigid than the pri&#383;on or the
guillotine. It is true, that, in the pre&#383;ent in&#383;tance, it
is not the ordinary and habitual practice of avarice that has
called forth the &#383;everity of the laws, but a &#383;pecies
&#383;o de&#383;tructive and exten&#383;ive in its
con&#383;equences, that much may be &#383;aid in defence of any
penalty &#383;hort of death; and &#383;uch is the general
di&#383;tru&#383;t of the paper-money, that I really believe, had
not &#383;ome mea&#383;ure of the kind been adopted, no article
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of monopoly would have been left for
con&#383;umption. There are, however, tho&#383;e who retort on the
government, and a&#383;&#383;ert, that the origin of the evil is in
the wa&#383;te and peculation of its agents, which al&#383;o make
the immen&#383;e emi&#383;&#383;ion of paper more
nece&#383;&#383;ary; and they are right in the fact, though not in
their deduction, for as the evil does exi&#383;t whatever may be
the cau&#383;e, it i&#383; certainly wi&#383;e to endeavour to
remedy it.</p>
<p>The po&#383;ition of Valenciennes, which is &#383;uppo&#383;ed
to be on the eve of a &#383;urrender&mdash;the progre&#383;s of the
in&#383;urgents in La Vendee&mdash;the di&#383;content&#383; in the
South&mdash;and the charge of treachery again&#383;t &#383;o many
of the Generals, and particularly Cu&#383;tine&mdash;all together
&#383;eem to have agitated the public extremely: yet it is rather
the agitation of uncertainty than that occa&#383;ioned by any deep
impre&#383;&#383;ion of hope or fear. The people wi&#383;h to be
relieved from their pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation, yet are without
any determinate views for the future; and, indeed, in this part of
the country, where they have neither leaders nor union, it would be
very difficult for them to take a more active part.</p>
<p>The party of the foederali&#383;ts langui&#383;h, merely
becau&#383;e it is nothing more than a party, and a party of which
the heads excite neither intere&#383;t nor e&#383;teem. I conclude
you learn from the papers all the more important events, and I
confine my&#383;elf, as u&#383;ual, to &#383;uch details as I think
le&#383;&#383; likely to reach you. The humanity of the
Engli&#383;h mu&#383;t often bani&#383;h their political
animo&#383;ities when they read what pa&#383;&#383;es here; and
thou&#383;ands of my countrymen mu&#383;t at this moment lament
with me the &#383;ituation to which France is reduced by projects
in which common &#383;en&#383;e can di&#383;tingui&#383;h no medium
between wickedne&#383;s and folly.</p>
<p>All apparent attachment to royali&#383;m is now cautiou&#383;ly
avoided, but the royali&#383;ts do not dimini&#383;h by
per&#383;ecution, and the indu&#383;try with which they propagate
their opinions is nearly a match for all the force armee of the
republicans.&mdash;It is not ea&#383;y to print pamphlets or
new&#383;papers, but there are certain &#383;hops which one would
think were di&#383;covered by in&#383;tinct, where are &#383;old a
variety of my&#383;terious emblems of royalty, &#383;uch as fans
that have no vi&#383;ible ornaments except land&#383;capes, &amp;c.
but when opened by the initiated, pre&#383;ent tolerable
likene&#383;&#383;es of the Royal Family; &#383;nuff-boxes with
&#383;ecret lids, containing miniature bu&#383;ts of the late King;
and mu&#383;ic &#383;o ingeniou&#383;ly printed, that what to the
common eye offers only &#383;ome popular air, when folded &#383;o
as to join the heads and tails of the notes together, forms
&#383;entences of very trea&#383;onable import, and by no means
flattering to the exi&#383;ting government&mdash;I have known
the&#383;e interdicted trifles purcha&#383;ed at extravagant prices
by the be&#383;t-reputed patriots, and by officers who in public
breathe nothing but unconquerable democracy, and dete&#383;tation
of Kings. Yet, though the&#383;e things are circulated with extreme
caution, every body has &#383;omething of the &#383;ort, and, as
Charles Surface &#383;ays, "for my part, I don't &#383;ee who is
out of the &#383;ecret."</p>
<p>The belief in religious miracles is exploded, and it is only in
political ones that the faith of the people is allowed to
exerci&#383;e it&#383;elf.&mdash;We have lately &#383;een exhibited
at the fairs and markets a calf, produced into the world with the
tri-coloured cockade on its head; and on the painted cloth that
announces the phoenomenon is the portrait of this natural
revolutioni&#383;t, with a mayor and municipality in their official
&#383;carfs, addre&#383;&#383;ing the four-footed patriot with
great ceremony.</p>
<p>We &#383;et out early to-morrow-morning for Soi&#383;&#383;ons,
which is about twenty leagues from hence. Travelling is not very
de&#383;irable in the pre&#383;ent circum&#383;tances, but Mad. de
F____ has &#383;ome affairs to &#383;ettle there which cannot well
be entru&#383;ted to a third per&#383;on. The times, however, have
a very ho&#383;tile appearance, and we intend, if
po&#383;&#383;ible, to be ab&#383;ent but three
days.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Soi&#383;&#383;ons, Augu&#383;t 4, 1793.</h2>
<p>"And you may go by Beauvais if you will, for which rea&#383;on
many go by Beauvais;" and the &#383;tranger who turns out of his
road to go by Soi&#383;&#383;ons, mu&#383;t u&#383;e the &#383;ame
rea&#383;oning, for the con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of having
exerci&#383;ed his free agency will be all his reward for
vi&#383;iting Soi&#383;&#383;ons. This, by the way; for my journey
hither not being one of curio&#383;ity, I have no right to
complain; yet &#383;omehow or other, by a&#383;&#383;ociating the
idea of the famous Va&#383;e, the ancient re&#383;idence of the
fir&#383;t French Kings, and other circum&#383;tances as little
connected as the&#383;e I &#383;uppo&#383;e with modern
hi&#383;tory, I had ranked Soi&#383;&#383;ons in my imagination as
one of the places I &#383;hould &#383;ee with intere&#383;t. I find
it, however, only a dull, decent-looking town, tolerably large, but
not very populous. In the new divi&#383;ion of France it is the
capital of the department De l'Ai&#383;ne, and is of cour&#383;e
the &#383;eat of the admini&#383;tration.</p>
<p>We left Peronne early, and, being &#383;o fortunate as to
encounter no accidental delays, we arrived within a league of
Soi&#383;&#383;ons early in the afternoon. Mad. de F____,
recollecting an acquaintance who has a chateau not far out of our
road, determined to &#383;top an hour or two; for, as &#383;he
&#383;aid, her friend was &#383;o "fond of the country," &#383;he
&#383;hould be &#383;ure to find him there. We did, indeed, find
this Mon&#383;ieur, who is &#383;o "fond of the country," at home,
extremely well powdered, dre&#383;&#383;ed in a &#383;triped
&#383;ilk coat, and engaged with a card party, on a warm afternoon
on the third of Augu&#383;t.&mdash;The chateau was &#383;ituated as
a French chateau u&#383;ually is, &#383;o a&#383; to be benefited
by all the noi&#383;es and odours of the village&mdash;built with a
large &#383;ingle front, and a number of windows &#383;o
judiciou&#383;ly placed, that it mu&#383;t be impo&#383;&#383;ible
either to be cool in &#383;ummer or warm in winter.</p>
<p>We walked out after taking &#383;ome coffee, and I learned that
this lover of the country did not keep a &#383;ingle acre of land
in his own hands, but that the part immediately contiguous to the
hou&#383;e was cultivated for a certain &#383;hare of the profit by
a farmer who lives in a mi&#383;erable looking place adjoining, and
where I &#383;aw the operations of the dairy-maid carried on
amid&#383;t pigs, ducks, and turkeys, who &#383;eemed to have
e&#383;tabli&#383;hed a very familiar acce&#383;s.</p>
<p>Previous to our arrival at Soi&#383;&#383;ons, the Marqui&#383;e
(who, though &#383;he doe&#383; not con&#383;ider me as an
ari&#383;tocrate, knows I am by no means a republican,) begged me
to be cautious in expre&#383;&#383;ing my &#383;entiments, as the
Comte de ____, where we were going, had embraced the principles of
the revolution very warmly, and had been much blamed by his family
on this account. Mad. de F____ added, that &#383;he had not
&#383;een him for above a year, but that &#383;he believed him
&#383;till to be "extremement patriote."</p>
<p>We reached Mons. de ____'s ju&#383;t as the family were &#383;et
down to a very moderate &#383;upper, and I ob&#383;erved that their
plate had been replaced by pewter. After the fir&#383;t
&#383;alutations were over, it was &#383;oon vi&#383;ible that the
political notions of the count were much changed. He is a
&#383;en&#383;ible reflecting man, and &#383;eems really to
wi&#383;h the good of his country. He thinks, with many others,
that all the good effects which might have been obtained by the
revolution will be lo&#383;t through the contempt and hatred which
the republican government has drawn upon it.</p>
<p>Mons. de ____ has two &#383;ons who have di&#383;tingui&#383;hed
them&#383;elves very honourably in the army, and he has
him&#383;elf made great pecuniary &#383;acrifices; but this has not
&#383;ecured him from numerous domiciliary vi&#383;it&#383; and
vexations of all kinds. The whole family are at intervals a little
pen&#383;ive, and Mons. de ____ told us, at a moment when the
ladies were ab&#383;ent, that the taking of Valenciennes had
occa&#383;ioned a violent fermentation at Paris, and that he had
&#383;erious apprehen&#383;ions for tho&#383;e who have the
mi&#383;fortune to be di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by their rank, or
obnoxiou&#383; from their &#383;uppo&#383;ed
principle&#383;&mdash;that he him&#383;elf, and all who were
pre&#383;umed to have an attachment to the con&#383;titution of
eighty-nine, were much more feared, and of cour&#383;e more
&#383;u&#383;pected, than the original
ari&#383;tocrate&#383;&mdash;and "enfin" that he had made up his
mind a la Francai&#383;e to the wor&#383;t that could happen.</p>
<p>I have ju&#383;t run over the papers of the day, and I perceive
that the debates of the Convention are filled with invectives
again&#383;t the Engli&#383;h. A letter has been very opportunely
found on the ramparts of Li&#383;le, which is intended to
per&#383;uade the people that the Briti&#383;h government ha&#383;
di&#383;tributed money and pho&#383;phoric matches in every town in
France&mdash;the one to provoke in&#383;urrection, the other to
&#383;et fire to the corn.* You will conclude this letter to be a
fabrication, and it is imagined and executed with &#383;o little
ingenuity, that I doubt whether it will impo&#383;e on the
mo&#383;t ignorant of the people for a moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* "The National Convention, in the name of violated
humanity, denounces to all the world, and to the people of England
in particular, the ba&#383;e, perfidious, and wicked conduct of the
Briti&#383;h government, which does not he&#383;itate to employ
fire, poi&#383;on, a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination, and every
other crime, to procure the triumph of tyranny, and the
de&#383;truction of the rights of man." (Decree, 1&#383;t
Augu&#383;t, 1793.)</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Queen has been tran&#383;ferred to the Conciergerie, or
common pri&#383;on, and a decree is pa&#383;&#383;ed for trying
her; but perhaps at this moment (whatever may be the re&#383;ult
hereafter) they only hope her &#383;ituation may operate a&#383; a
check upon the enemy; at lea&#383;t I have heard it doubted by many
whether they intend to proceed &#383;eriou&#383;ly on this trial
&#383;o long threatened.&mdash; Perhaps I may have before noticed
to you that the convention never &#383;eemed capable of any thing
great or uniform, and that all their proceeding&#383; took a tinge
from that frivolity and meanne&#383;s which I am almo&#383;t
tempted to believe inherent in the French character. They have
ju&#383;t now, amid&#383;t a long &#383;tring of decrees, the
objects of which are of the fir&#383;t con&#383;equence,
in&#383;erted one for the de&#383;truction of all the royal
tomb&#383; before the tenth of Augu&#383;t, and another for
reducing the expences of the King's children, particularly their
food, to bare nece&#383;&#383;aries. Had our Engli&#383;h
revolutioni&#383;ts thus employed them&#383;elves, they might have
expelled the &#383;culptured Monarchs from the Abbey, and waged a
very &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful war on the admirers of Gothic
antiquity; but neither the Stuarts, nor the Catholic religion,
would have had much to fear from them.</p>
<p>We have been wandering about the town all day, and I have not
remarked that the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es of the enemy have
occa&#383;ioned any regret. When I wa&#383; in France three years
ago, you may recollect that my letters u&#383;ually contained
&#383;ome relation of our embarra&#383;&#383;ment and delays, owing
to the fear and ignorance of the people. At one place they
apprehended the introduction of foreign troop&#383;&mdash;at
another, that the Comte d'Artois wa&#383; to burn all the corn. In
&#383;hort, the whole country teemed with plots and counterplots,
every one of which was more ab&#383;urd and inexplicable than
tho&#383;e of Oates, with his whole tribe of Je&#383;uits. At
pre&#383;ent, when a powerful army is invading the frontiers, and
people have not in many places bread to eat, they &#383;eem to be
very little &#383;olicitous about the former, and as little
di&#383;po&#383;ed to blame the ari&#383;tocrates for the
latter.</p>
<p>It is really extraordinary, after all the pains that have been
taken to excite hatred and re&#383;entment again&#383;t the
Engli&#383;h, that I have not heard of a &#383;ingle in&#383;tance
of their having been in&#383;ulted or mole&#383;ted. Whatever
inconveniencies they may have been &#383;ubjected to, were acts of
the government, not of the people; and perhaps this is the
fir&#383;t war between the two nations in which the rever&#383;e
has not been the ca&#383;e.</p>
<p>I accompanied Mad. de ____ this afternoon to the hou&#383;e of a
rich merchant, where &#383;he had bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and who,
&#383;he told me, had been a furious patriot, but his ardour is now
con&#383;iderably abated. He had ju&#383;t returned from the
department, [Here u&#383;ed for the place where the public
bu&#383;ine&#383;s is tran&#383;acted.] where his affairs had led
him; and he a&#383;&#383;ure&#383; us, that in general the agents
of the republic were more inacce&#383;&#383;ible, more
in&#383;olent, corrupt, and ignorant, than any employed under the
old government. He demurred to paying Mad. de ____ a &#383;um of
money all in <i>a&#383;&#383;ignats a face;</i>* and this famous
patriot would readily have given me an hundred livres for a pound
&#383;terling.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* <i>A&#383;&#383;ignats a face</i>&mdash;that is, with
the King's effigy; at this time greatly preferred to tho&#383;e
i&#383;&#383;ued after his death.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We &#383;hall return to Peronne to-morrow, and I have availed
my&#383;elf of the hour between cards and &#383;upper, which is
u&#383;ually employed by the French in undre&#383;&#383;ing, to
&#383;cribble my remarks. In &#383;ome families, I
&#383;uppo&#383;e, &#383;upping in di&#383;habille is an
arrangement of oeconomy, in others of ea&#383;e; but I always think
it has the air of preparation for a very &#383;olid meal; and, in
effect, &#383;upping is not a mere ceremony with either &#383;ex in
this country.</p>
<p>I learnt in conver&#383;ation with M. de ____, who&#383;e
&#383;ons were at Famars when the camp was forced, that the carnage
was terrible, and that the lo&#383;s of the French on this
occa&#383;ion amounted to &#383;everal thou&#383;ands. You will be
informed of this much more accurately in England, but you will
&#383;carcely imagine that no official account was ever
publi&#383;hed here, and that in general the people are ignorant of
the circum&#383;tance, and all the di&#383;a&#383;ters attending
it. In England, you have oppo&#383;ition papers that amply
&#383;upply the omi&#383;&#383;ions of the mini&#383;terial
gazettes, and often dwell with much complacence on the
lo&#383;&#383;es and defeats of their country; here none will
venture to publi&#383;h the lea&#383;t event which they
&#383;uppo&#383;e the government wi&#383;h to keep concealed. I am
told, a leading feature of republican governments is to be
extremely jealous of the liberty of the pre&#383;s, and that of
France is, in this re&#383;pect, truly republican.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h2>Peronne, Augu&#383;t, 1793.</h2>
<p>I have often regretted, my dear brother, that my letters have
for &#383;ome time been rather intended to &#383;ati&#383;fy your
curio&#383;ity than your affection. At this moment I feel
differently, and I rejoice that the inquietude and danger of my
&#383;ituation will, probably, not come to your knowledge till I
&#383;hall be no longer &#383;ubject to them. I have been for
&#383;everal days unwell, and yet my body, valetudinarian as I am
at be&#383;t, is now the better part of me; for my mind has been
&#383;o deranged by &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e and terror, that I
expect to recover my health long before I &#383;hall be able to
tranquillize my &#383;pirits.</p>
<p>On our return from Soi&#383;&#383;ons I found, by the public
prints, that a decree had pa&#383;&#383;ed for arre&#383;ting all
natives of the countries with which France is at war, and who had
not con&#383;tantly re&#383;ided there &#383;ince
1789.&mdash;Thi&#383; intelligence, as you will conceive,
&#383;ufficiently alarmed me, and I lo&#383;t no time in
con&#383;ulting Mad. de ____'s friends on the &#383;ubject, who
were generally of opinion that the decree was merely a menace, and
that it wa&#383; too unju&#383;t to be put in execution. As
&#383;ome days elap&#383;ed and no &#383;tep&#383; were taken in
con&#383;equence, I began to think they were right, and my
&#383;pirits were &#383;omewhat revived; when one evening, as I was
preparing to go to bed, my maid &#383;uddenly entered the room,
and, before &#383;he could give me any previous explanation, the
apartment was filled with armed men. A&#383; &#383;oon as I was
collected enough to enquire the object of this
un&#383;ea&#383;onable vi&#383;it, I learned that all this military
apparel was to put the &#383;eals on my papers, and convey my
per&#383;on to the Hotel de Ville!&mdash;I knew it would be vain to
remon&#383;trated, and therefore made an effort to recover my
&#383;pirits and &#383;ubmit. The bu&#383;ine&#383;s, however, was
not yet terminated, my papers were to be &#383;ealed&mdash;and
though they were not very voluminous, the proce&#383;s was more
difficult than you would imagine, none of the company having been
employed on affairs of the kind before. A debate en&#383;ued on the
manner in which it &#383;hould be done, and, after a very
tumultuou&#383; di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion, it was
&#383;agaciou&#383;ly concluded to &#383;eal up the doors and
window&#383; of all the apartments appropriated to my u&#383;e.
They then di&#383;covered that they had no &#383;eal fit for the
purpo&#383;e, and a new con&#383;ultation was holden on the
propriety of affixing a cypher which was offered them by one of the
Garde Nationale.</p>
<p>This weighty matter being at length decided, the doors of my
bedchamber, dre&#383;&#383;ing-room, and of the apartments with
which they communicated, were carefully fa&#383;tened up, though
not without an ob&#383;ervation on my part that I was only a
gue&#383;t at Mad. de ____'s, and that an order to &#383;eize my
papers or per&#383;on was not a mandate for rendering a part of her
home u&#383;ele&#383;s. But there was no rea&#383;oning with
ignorance and a &#383;core of bayonets, nor could I obtain
permi&#383;&#383;ion even to take &#383;ome linen out of my
drawers. On going down &#383;tairs, I found the court and avenues
to the garden amply guarded, and with this numerous e&#383;cort,
and accompanied by Mad. de ____, I was conducted to the Hotel de
Ville. I know not what re&#383;i&#383;tance they might expect from
a &#383;ingle female, but, to judge by their precautions, they
mu&#383;t have deemed the adventure a very perilous one. When we
arrived at the Hotel de Ville, it was near eleven o'clock: the hall
was crouded, and a young man, in a dirty linen jacket and
trow&#383;er&#383; and dirty linen, with the air of a
Poli&#383;&#383;on and the countenance of an
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in, was haranguing with great vehemence
again&#383;t the Engli&#383;h, who, he a&#383;&#383;erted, were all
agents of Pitt, (e&#383;pecially the women,) and were to &#383;et
fire to the corn, and corrupt the garri&#383;ons of the fortified
towns.&mdash; The people li&#383;tened to the&#383;e terrible
projects with a &#383;tupid &#383;ort of &#383;urprize, and, for
the mo&#383;t part, &#383;eemed either very carele&#383;s or very
incredulous. As &#383;oon as this inflammatory piece of eloquence
wa&#383; fini&#383;hed, I was pre&#383;ented to the ill-looking
orator, who, I learned, wa&#383; a repre&#383;entant du peuple. It
was very ea&#383;y to perceive that my &#383;pirit&#383; were quite
overpowered, and that I could with difficulty &#383;upport
my&#383;elf; but this did not prevent the repre&#383;entant du
peuple from treating me with that incon&#383;iderable brutality
which is commonly the effect of a &#383;udden acce&#383;&#383;ion
of power on narrow and vulgar minds. After a variety of impertinent
que&#383;tions, menaces of a pri&#383;on for my&#383;elf, and
exclamation&#383; of hatred and vengeance again&#383;t my country,
on producing &#383;ome friends of Mad. de ____, who were to be
an&#383;werable for me, I was relea&#383;ed, and returned home more
dead than alive.</p>
<p>You mu&#383;t not infer, from what I have related, that I was
particularly di&#383;tingui&#383;hed on this occa&#383;ion, for
though I have no acquaintance with the Engli&#383;h here, I
under&#383;tand they had all been treated much in the &#383;ame
manner.&mdash;As &#383;oon as the repre&#383;entant had left the
town, by dint of &#383;olicitation we prevailed on the municipality
to take the &#383;eal off the rooms, and content them&#383;elves
with &#383;electing and &#383;ecuring my papers, which was done
ye&#383;terday by a commi&#383;&#383;ion, formally appointed for
the purpo&#383;e. I know not the quality of the good citizens to
whom thi&#383; important charge was entru&#383;ted, but I concluded
from their co&#383;tume that they had been more u&#383;efully
employed the preceding part of the day at the anvil and la&#383;t.
It is certain, however, they had undertaken a
bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383; greatly beyond their powers. They indeed
turned over all my trunks and drawers, and dived to the bottom of
water-jugs and flower-jars with great zeal, but neglected to
&#383;earch a large portfolio that lay on the table, probably from
not knowing the u&#383;e of it; and my &#383;ervant conveyed away
&#383;ome letters, while I amu&#383;ed them with the &#383;ight of
a blue-bottle fly through a micro&#383;cope. They were at
fir&#383;t much puzzled to know whether books and mu&#383;ic were
included under the article of papers, and were very de&#383;irous
of burning a hi&#383;tory of France, becau&#383;e they
di&#383;covered, by the title-plate, that it was "about Kings;" but
the mo&#383;t difficult part of this momentous tran&#383;action was
taking an account of it in writing. However, as only one of the
company could write, there was no di&#383;puting as to the
&#383;cribe, though there was much about the manner of execution. I
did not &#383;ee the compo&#383;ition, but I could hear that it
&#383;tated "comme quoi," they had found the &#383;eals unbroken,
"comme quoi," they had taken them off, and divers "as how&#383;" of
the &#383;ame kind. The whole being concluded, and my papers
depo&#383;ited in a box, I was at length freed from my gue&#383;ts,
and left in po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of my apartments.</p>
<p>It is impo&#383;&#383;ible to account for this treatment of the
Engli&#383;h by any mode of rea&#383;oning that does not exclude
both ju&#383;tice and policy; and viewing it only as a &#383;ymptom
of that de&#383;perate wickedne&#383;s which commits evil, not as a
means, but an end, I am extremely alarmed for our &#383;ituation.
At this moment the whole of French politics &#383;eems to center in
an endeavour to render the Engli&#383;h odious both as a nation and
as individuals. The Convention, the clubs, and the &#383;treets of
Paris, re&#383;ound with low abu&#383;e of this tendency; and a
motion was made in the former, by one Garnier, to procure the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination of Mr. Pitt. Couthon, a member of
the Comite de Salut Publique, has propo&#383;ed and carried a
decree to declare him the enemy of mankind; and the citizens of
Paris are &#383;tunned by the hawkers of Mr. Pitt's plots with the
Queen to "&#383;tarve all France," and "ma&#383;&#383;acre all the
patriots."&mdash;Amid&#383;t &#383;o many effort&#383;* to provoke
the de&#383;truction of the Engli&#383;h, it is wonderful, when we
con&#383;ider the &#383;anguinary character which the French people
have lately evinced, that we are yet &#383;afe, and it is in effect
only to be accounted for by their di&#383;inclination to take any
part in the animo&#383;ities of their government.</p>

<blockquote>* When our repre&#383;entative appeared at Abbeville
with an intention of arre&#383;ting the Engli&#383;h and other
foreigners, the people, to whom the&#383;e mi&#383;&#383;ionaries
with unlimited powers were yet new, took the alarm, and became very
apprehen&#383;ive that he was come likewi&#383;e to di&#383;arm
their Garde Nationale. The &#383;treets were crouded, the town
hou&#383;e was be&#383;et, and Citizen Dumout found it
nece&#383;&#383;ary to quiet the town's people by the following
proclamation. One part of hi&#383; purpo&#383;e, that of
in&#383;uring his per&#383;onal &#383;afety, was an&#383;wered by
it; but that of exciting the people again&#383;t the Engli&#383;h,
failed&mdash; in&#383;omuch, that I was told even the lowe&#383;t
cla&#383;&#383;es, &#383;o far from giving credit to the malignant
calumnies propagated again&#383;t the Engli&#383;h, openly
regretted their arre&#383;tation. "Citizens, "On my arrival
among&#383;t you, I little thought that malevolence would be
&#383;o far &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful as to alarm you on the
motives of my vi&#383;it. Could the ari&#383;tocrates, then,
flatter them&#383;elves with the hope of making you believe I had
the intention of di&#383;arming you? Be deaf, I be&#383;eech you,
to &#383;o ab&#383;urd a calumny, and &#383;eize on tho&#383;e who
propagate it. I came here to fraternize with you, and to
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t you in getting rid of tho&#383;e malcontents
and foreigners, who are &#383;triving to de&#383;troy the republic
by the mo&#383;t infernal manoeuvres.&mdash;An horrible plot has
been conceived. Our harve&#383;ts are to be fired by means of
pho&#383;phoric matches, and all the patriots
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inated. Women, prie&#383;ts, and
foreigners, are the in&#383;truments employed by the coale&#383;ced
de&#383;pots, and by England above all, to accompli&#383;h
the&#383;e criminal de&#383;igns.&mdash;A law of the fir&#383;t of
this month orders the arre&#383;t of all foreigners born in the
countries with which the republic is at war, and not &#383;ettled
in France before the month of July, 1789. In execution of this law
I have required domiciliary vi&#383;its to be made. I have urged
the pre&#383;ervation of the public tranquillity. I have therefore
done my duty, and only what all good citizens mu&#383;t
approve."</blockquote>

<p>I have ju&#383;t received a few lines from Mrs. D____, written
in French, and put in the po&#383;t without &#383;ealing. I
perceive, by the contents, though &#383;he enters into no details,
that circum&#383;tances &#383;imilar to tho&#383;e I have
de&#383;cribed have likewi&#383;e taken place at Amiens. In
addition to my other anxieties, I have the pro&#383;pect of a long
&#383;eparation from my friends; for though I am not in
confinement, I cannot, while the decree which arre&#383;ted me
remains in force, quit the town of Peronne. I have not often looked
forward with &#383;o little hope, or &#383;o little certainty, and
though a fir&#383;t-rate philo&#383;opher might make up his mind to
a particular event, yet to be prepared for any thing, and all
things, is a more difficult matter.</p>
<p>The hi&#383;tories of Greece and Rome have long con&#383;tituted
the grand re&#383;ources of French eloquence, and it is not till
within a few days that an orator has di&#383;covered all this good
learning to be of no u&#383;e&mdash;not, a&#383; you might imagine,
becau&#383;e the moral character and political &#383;ituation of
the French differ from tho&#383;e of the Greeks and Romans, but
becau&#383;e they are &#383;uperior to all the people who ever
exi&#383;ted, and ought to be cited a&#383; models, in&#383;tead of
de&#383;cending to become copyi&#383;ts. "Therefore, continue&#383;
this Jacobin &#383;age, (who&#383;e name is Henriot, and who is
highly popular,) let us burn all the libraries and all the
antiquities, and have no guide but our&#383;elve&#383;&mdash;let us
cut off the heads of all the Deputies who have not voted according
to our principles, bani&#383;h or impri&#383;on all the gentry and
the clergy, and guillotine the Queen and General Cu&#383;tine!"</p>
<p>The&#383;e are the u&#383;ual &#383;ubjects of
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion at the clubs, and the Convention
it&#383;elf is not much more decent. I tremble when I recollect
that I am in a country where a member of the legi&#383;lature
propo&#383;es reward&#383; for a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination,
and the leader of a &#383;ociety, that pretends to inform and
in&#383;truct the people, argues in favour of burning all the
books. The French are on the eve of exhibiting the &#383;ingular
&#383;pectacle of a nation enlightened by &#383;cience,
accu&#383;tomed to the benefit of laws and the enjoyment of arts,
&#383;uddenly becoming barbarous by &#383;y&#383;tem, and
&#383;inking into ignorance from choice.&mdash;When the Goths
&#383;hared the mo&#383;t curiou&#383; antiques by weight, were
they not more civilized than the Pari&#383;ian of 1793, who
di&#383;turbs the a&#383;hes of Henry the Fourth, or de&#383;troys
the monument of Turenne, by a decree?&mdash;I have my&#383;elf been
forced to an act very much in the &#383;pirit of the times, but I
could not, without ri&#383;king my own &#383;afety, do
otherwi&#383;e; and I &#383;at up late la&#383;t night for the
purpo&#383;e of burning Burke, which I had brought with me, but had
fortunately &#383;o well concealed, that it e&#383;caped the late
inqui&#383;ition. I indeed made thi&#383; &#383;acrifice to
prudence with great unwillingne&#383;&#383;&mdash;every day, by
confirming Mr. Burke's a&#383;&#383;ertions, or fulfilling his
predictions, had &#383;o increa&#383;ed my reverence for the work,
that I regarded it as a kind of political oracle. I did not,
however, de&#383;troy it without an apologetic apo&#383;trophe to
the author's benevolence, which I am &#383;ure would &#383;uffer,
were he to be the occa&#383;ion, though involuntarily, of
conducting a female to a pri&#383;on or the Guillotine.</p>
<p>"How chances mock, and changes fill the cup of alteration up
with diver&#383; liquors."&mdash;On the &#383;ame hearth, and in a
mingled flame, was con&#383;umed the very con&#383;titution of
1789, on which Mr. Burke's book was a cen&#383;ure, and which would
now expo&#383;e me to equal danger were it to be found in my
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion. In collecting the a&#383;hes of
the&#383;e two compo&#383;itions, the tendency of which is &#383;o
different, (for &#383;uch is the complexion of the moment, that I
would not have even the &#383;ervant &#383;u&#383;pect I had been
burning a quantity of papers,) I could not but moralize on the
mutability of popular opinion. Mr. Burke's Gallic adver&#383;aries
are now mo&#383;t of them pro&#383;cribed and anathematized more
than him&#383;elf. Perhaps another year may &#383;ee his bu&#383;t
erected on the piede&#383;tal which now &#383;upports that of
Brutu&#383; or Le Pelletier.</p>
<p>The letters I have written to you &#383;ince the communication
wa&#383; interrupted, with &#383;ome other papers that I am
&#383;olicitous to pre&#383;erve, I have hitherto always carried
about me, and I know not if any danger, merely probable, will
induce me to part with them. You will not, I think,
&#383;u&#383;pect me of attaching any con&#383;equence to my
&#383;cribblings from vanity; and if I run &#383;ome per&#383;onal
ri&#383;k in keeping them, it is becau&#383;e the &#383;ituation of
this country is &#383;o &#383;ingular, and the events which occur
almo&#383;t daily &#383;o important, that the remarks of any one
who is unlucky enough to be a &#383;pectator, may intere&#383;t,
without the advantage of literary talents.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Peronne, Augu&#383;t 24, 1793.</h2>
<p>I have been out to-day for the fir&#383;t time &#383;ince the
arre&#383;t of the Engli&#383;h, and, though I have few
acquaintances here, my adventure at the Hotel de Ville has gained
me a &#383;ort of popularity. I was &#383;aluted by many people I
did not know, and overwhelmed with expre&#383;&#383;ions of regret
for what had happened, or congratulations on my having e&#383;caped
&#383;o well.</p>
<p>The French are not commonly very much alive to the
&#383;ufferings of others, and it is &#383;ome mortification to my
vanity that I cannot, but at the expence of a reproaching
con&#383;cience, a&#383;cribe the civilities I have experienced on
this occa&#383;ion to my per&#383;onal merit. It would
doubtle&#383;&#383; have been highly flattering to me to relate the
tender and general intere&#383;t I had excited even among this
cold-hearted people, who &#383;carcely feel for them&#383;elves:
but the truth is, they are di&#383;po&#383;ed to take the part of
any one whom they think per&#383;ecuted by their government; and
their repre&#383;entative, Dumont, is &#383;o much
de&#383;pi&#383;ed in his private character, and dete&#383;ted in
his public one, that it &#383;uffices to have been ill treated by
him, to en&#383;ure one a con&#383;iderable portion of the public
good will.</p>
<p>This di&#383;po&#383;ition is not a little con&#383;olatory, at
a time when the whole rage of an oligarchical tyranny, though
impotent again&#383;t the Engli&#383;h as a nation, meanly
exhau&#383;ts it&#383;elf on the few helple&#383;s individuals
within it&#383; power. Embarra&#383;&#383;ments accumulate and if
Mr. Pitt's agents did not mo&#383;t obligingly write letters, and
the&#383;e letters happen to be intercepted ju&#383;t when they are
mo&#383;t nece&#383;&#383;ary, the Comite de Salut Publique would
be at a lo&#383;s how to account for them.</p>
<p>A&#383;&#383;ignats have fallen into a di&#383;credit beyond
example, an hundred and thirty livres having been given for one
Louis-d'or; and, as if this were not the natural re&#383;ult of
circum&#383;tances like the pre&#383;ent, a corre&#383;pondence
between two Engli&#383;hmen informs us, that it is the work of Mr.
Pitt, who, with an unparalleled ingenuity, has contrived to
&#383;end couriers to every town in France, to concert
mea&#383;ures with the banker&#383; for this purpo&#383;e. But if
we may believe Barrere, one of the members of the Committee, this
atrocious policy of Mr. Pitt will not be unrevenged, for another
intercepted letter contains a&#383;&#383;urances that an hundred
thou&#383;and men have taken up arms in England, and are preparing
to march again&#383;t the iniquitous metropolis that gives this
obnoxious Mini&#383;ter &#383;helter.</p>
<p>My &#383;ituation is &#383;till the &#383;ame&mdash;I have no
hope of returning to Amiens, and have ju&#383;t rea&#383;on to be
apprehen&#383;ive for my tranquillity here. I had a long
conver&#383;ation this morning with two people whom Dumont has left
here to keep the town in order during his ab&#383;ence. The
&#383;ubject was to prevail on them to give me a
permi&#383;&#383;ion to leave Peronne, but I could not
&#383;ucceed. They were not, I believe, indi&#383;po&#383;ed to
gratify me, but were afraid of involving them&#383;elves. One of
them expre&#383;&#383;ed much partiality for the Engli&#383;h, but
was very vehement in his di&#383;approbation of their form of
government, which he &#383;aid was "dete&#383;table." My cowardice
did not permit me to argue much in its behalf, (for I look upon
the&#383;e people a&#383; more dangerous than the &#383;pies of the
old police,) and I only ventured to ob&#383;erve, with great
diffidence, that though the Engli&#383;h government wa&#383;
monarchical, yet the power of the Crown was very much limited; and
that as the chief &#383;ubjects of our complaints at pre&#383;ent
were not our in&#383;titutions, but certain practical errors, they
might be remedied without any violent or radical changes; and that
our nobility were neither numerous nor privileged, and by no means
obnoxious to the majority of the people.&mdash;<i>"Ah, vous avez
donc de la noble&#383;&#383;e ble&#383;&#383;e en Angleterre, ce
&#383;ont peut-etre les milords,"</i> ["What, you have nobility in
England then? The milords, I &#383;uppo&#383;e."] exclaimed our
republican, and it operated on my whole &#383;y&#383;tem of defence
like my uncle Toby's &#383;moke-jack, for there was certainly no
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing the Engli&#383;h con&#383;titution with a
political critic, who I found was ignorant even of the
exi&#383;tence of a third branch of it; yet this reformer of
governments and abhorrer of Kings has power delegated to him more
exten&#383;ive than tho&#383;e of an Engli&#383;h Sovereign, though
I doubt if he can write his own language; and his moral reputation
is &#383;till le&#383;s in his favour than his ignorance&mdash;for,
previou&#383; to the revolution, he was known only as a kind of
&#383;windler, and has more than once been nearly convicted of
forgery.&mdash;This is, however, the de&#383;cription of people now
chiefly employed, for no hone&#383;t man would accept of &#383;uch
commi&#383;&#383;ions, nor perform the &#383;ervices annexed to
them.</p>
<p>Bread continues very &#383;carce, and the populace of Paris are,
as u&#383;ual, very turbulent; &#383;o that the neighbouring
departments are deprived of their &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence to
&#383;ati&#383;fy the wants of a metropolis that has no claim to an
exemption from the general di&#383;tre&#383;s, but that which
ari&#383;es from the fears of the Convention. As far as I have
opportunity of learning or ob&#383;erving, this part of France is
in that &#383;tate of tranquillity which i&#383; not the effect of
content but &#383;upinene&#383;s; the people do not love their
government, but they &#383;ubmit to it, and their utmo&#383;t
exertions amount only to a little occa&#383;ional ob&#383;tinacy,
which a few dragoons always reduce to compliance. We are
&#383;ometimes alarmed by reports that parties of the enemy are
approaching the town, when the gates are &#383;hut, and the great
bell is toll'd; but I do not perceive that the people are violently
apprehen&#383;ive about the matter. Their fears are, I believe, for
the mo&#383;t part, rather per&#383;onal than political&mdash;they
do not dread &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to the Au&#383;trians, but
military licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s.</p>
<p>I have been reading this afternoon Lord Orrery's definition of
the male Ceci&#383;beo, and it reminds me that I have not yet
noticed to you a very important cla&#383;s of females in France,
who may not improperly be denominated female Ceci&#383;beos. Under
the old &#383;y&#383;tem, when the rank of a woman of fa&#383;hion
had enabled her to pre&#383;erve a degree of reputation and
influence, in &#383;pite of the gallantries of her youth and the
decline of her charms, &#383;he adopted the equivocal character I
here allude to, and, relinqui&#383;hing the adorations claimed by
beauty, and the re&#383;pect due to age, charitably devoted
her&#383;elf to the in&#383;truction and advancement of &#383;ome
young man of per&#383;onal qualifications and uncertain fortune.
She pre&#383;ented him to the world, panegyrized him into
fa&#383;hion, and in&#383;ured hi&#383; con&#383;equence with one
&#383;et of females, by hinting his &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es with
another. By her exertions he was promoted in the army or
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed at the levee, and a career begun under
&#383;uch au&#383;pices often terminated in a brilliant
e&#383;tabli&#383;hment.&mdash;In the le&#383;s elevated circle, a
female Ceci&#383;beo is u&#383;ually of a certain age, of an active
di&#383;po&#383;ition, and great volubility, and her functions are
more numerous and le&#383;s dignified. Here the grand objects are
not to be&#383;iege Mini&#383;ters, nor give a "ton" to the protege
at a fa&#383;hionable ruelle, but to obtain for him the &#383;olid
advantages of what &#383;he calls <i>"un bon parti."</i> [A good
match.] To thi&#383; end &#383;he frequents the hou&#383;es of
widows and heire&#383;&#383;es, vaunts the docility of his temper,
and the greatne&#383;s of his expectations, enlarges on the
&#383;olitude of widowhood, or the dependence and
in&#383;ignificance of a &#383;pin&#383;ter; and the&#383;e
prefatory encomiums u&#383;ually end in the concerted introduction
of the Platonic "ami."</p>
<p>But be&#383;ides the&#383;e principal and important cares, a
female Ceci&#383;beo of the middle rank has various
&#383;ubordinate one&#383;&mdash;&#383;uch as buying linen,
choo&#383;ing the colour of a coat, or the pattern of a
wai&#383;tcoat, with all the minutiae of the favourite's
dre&#383;s, in which &#383;he is always con&#383;ulted at
lea&#383;t, if &#383;he has not the whole direction.</p>
<p>It is not only in the fir&#383;t or intermediate
cla&#383;&#383;es that the&#383;e u&#383;eful females abound, they
are equally common in more humble &#383;ituations, and only differ
in their employments, not in their principles. A woman in France,
whatever be her condition, cannot be per&#383;uaded to re&#383;ign
her influence with her youth; and the bourgeoi&#383;e who has no
preten&#383;ions to court favour or the di&#383;po&#383;al of
wealthy heire&#383;&#383;es, attaches her eleve by knitting him
&#383;tockings, forcing him with bons morceaux till he has an
indige&#383;tion, and frequent regales of coffee and liqueur.</p>
<p>You mu&#383;t not conclude from all this that there is any
gallantry implied, or any &#383;candal excited&mdash;the return for
all the&#383;e &#383;ervices is only a little flattery, a
philo&#383;ophic endurance of the card-table, and &#383;ome
&#383;kill in the di&#383;orders of lap-dogs. I know there are in
England, as well as in France, many notable females of a certain
age, who delight in what they call managing, and who are zealous in
promoting, matches among the young people of their acquaintance;
but for one that you meet with in England there are fifty here.</p>
<p>I doubt much if, upon the whole, the morals of the Engli&#383;h
women are not &#383;uperior to tho&#383;e of the French; but
however the que&#383;tion may be decided as to morals, I believe
their &#383;uperiority in decency of manners i&#383;
indi&#383;putable&mdash;and this &#383;uperiority is, perhaps, more
con&#383;picuous in women of a certain age, than in the younger
part of the &#383;ex. We have a &#383;ort of national regard for
propriety, which deters a female from lingering on the confines of
gallantry, when age has warned her to withdraw; and an old woman
that &#383;hould take a pa&#383;&#383;ionate and exclu&#383;ive
intere&#383;t about a young man not related to her, would become at
lea&#383;t an object of ridicule, if not of cen&#383;ure:&mdash;yet
in France nothing is more common; every old woman appropriates
&#383;ome youthful dangler, and, what is extraordinary, his
attentions are not di&#383;tingui&#383;hable from tho&#383;e he
would pay to a younger object.&mdash;I &#383;hould remark, however,
as &#383;ome apology for the&#383;e juvenile gallants, that there
are very few of what we call Tabbies in France; that is, females of
&#383;evere principles and contracted features, in who&#383;e
apparel every pin has its de&#383;tination with mathematical
exactne&#383;s, who are the very watch-towers of a neighbourhood,
and who give the alarm on the fir&#383;t appearance of incipient
frailty. Here, antique dowagers and faded &#383;pin&#383;ters are
all gay, laughing, rouged, and indulgent&mdash;&#383;o that 'bating
the &#383;ubtraction of teeth and addition of wrinkles, the
di&#383;parity between one &#383;core and four is not &#383;o
great:</p>

</pre></td>

</table>
</center>
<p>I know if I venture to add a word in defence of Tabbyhood, I
&#383;hall be engaged in a war with your&#383;elf and all our young
acquaintance; yet in this age, which &#383;o liberally
"&#383;oftens, and blends, and weakens, and dilute&#383;" away all
di&#383;tinctions, I own I am not without &#383;ome partiality for
&#383;trong lines of demarcation; and, perhaps, when fifty
retrograde&#383; into fifteen, it makes a wor&#383;e confu&#383;ion

<h2>Peronne, Augu&#383;t 29, 1793.</h2>
<p>The political horizon of France threatens nothing but
tempe&#383;ts. If we are &#383;till tranquil here, it is only
becau&#383;e the &#383;torm is retarded, and, far from deeming
our&#383;elves &#383;ecure from its violence, we &#383;uffer in
apprehen&#383;ion almo&#383;t as much as at other places is
&#383;uffered in reality. An hundred and fifty people have been
arre&#383;ted at Amiens in one night, and numbers of the gentry in
the neighbouring towns have &#383;hared the &#383;ame fate. This
mea&#383;ure, which I under&#383;tand is general throughout the
republic, has occa&#383;ioned great alarms, and is beheld by the
ma&#383;s of the people them&#383;elves with regret. In &#383;ome
towns, the Bourgeois have petitions to the Repre&#383;entatives on
mi&#383;&#383;ion in behalf of their gentry thus impri&#383;oned:
but, far from &#383;ucceeding, all who have &#383;igned &#383;uch
petitions are menaced and intimidated, and the terror is &#383;o
much increa&#383;ed, that I doubt if even this &#383;light effort
will be repeated any where.</p>
<p>The levee en ma&#383;&#383;e, or ri&#383;ing in a body, which
has been for &#383;ome time decreed, has not yet taken place. There
are very few, I believe, that comprehend it, and fewer who are
di&#383;po&#383;ed to comply. Many con&#383;ultation&#383; have
been holden, many plans propo&#383;ed; but as the re&#383;ult of
all the&#383;e con&#383;ultations and plans is to &#383;end a
certain number to the frontiers, the &#383;uffrages have never been
unanimous except in giving their negative.&mdash; Like
Fal&#383;taff's troops, every one has &#383;ome good cau&#383;e of
exemption; and if you were to attend a meeting where this affair is
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed, you would conclude the French to be more
phy&#383;ically mi&#383;erable than any people on the glove.
Youths, in apparent good health, have internal di&#383;orders, or
concealed infirmitie&#383;&mdash;&#383;ome are
near-&#383;ighted&mdash;others epileptic&mdash;one i&#383; nervous,
and cannot pre&#383;ent a mu&#383;quet&mdash;another is rheumatic,
and cannot carry it. In &#383;hort, according to their account,
they are a collection of the lame, the halt, and the blind, and
fitter to &#383;end to the ho&#383;pital, than to take the field.
But, in &#383;pite of all the&#383;e di&#383;orders and
incapacities, a con&#383;iderable levy mu&#383;t be made, and the
dragoons will, I dare &#383;ay, operate very wonderful cures.</p>
<p>The &#383;urrender of Dunkirk to the Engli&#383;h is regarded as
inevitable. I am not politician enough to fore&#383;ee the
con&#383;equences of &#383;uch an event, but the hopes and
anxieties of all parties &#383;eem directed thither, as if the fate
of the war depended on it. As for my own wi&#383;hes on the
&#383;ubject, they are not national, and if I &#383;ecretly invoke
the God of Armies for the &#383;ucce&#383;s of my countrymen, it is
becau&#383;e I think all that tends to de&#383;troy the
pre&#383;ent French government may be beneficial to mankind.
Indeed, the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es of war can at no time gratify
a thinking mind farther than a&#383; they tend to the
e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of peace.</p>
<p>After &#383;everal days of a mockery which was called a trial,
though the witne&#383;&#383;es were afraid to appear, or the
Coun&#383;el to plead in his favour, Cu&#383;tine has &#383;uffered
at the Guillotine. I can be no judge of hi&#383; military conduct,
and Heaven alone can judge of his intentions. None of the charges
were, however, &#383;ub&#383;tantiated, and many of them were
ab&#383;urd or frivolous. Mo&#383;t likely, he has been
&#383;acrificed to a cabal, and hi&#383; de&#383;truction makes a
part of that &#383;y&#383;tem of policy, which, by agitating the
minds of the people with &#383;u&#383;picions of univer&#383;al
trea&#383;on and unfathomable plots, leaves them no re&#383;ource
but implicit &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to their popular
leaders.</p>
<p>The death of Cu&#383;tine &#383;eems rather to have
&#383;timulated than appea&#383;ed the barbarity of the
Pari&#383;ian mob. At every defeat of their armies they call for
executions, and &#383;everal of tho&#383;e on whom the lot has
fallen to march again&#383;t the enemy have &#383;tipulated, at the
tribune of the Jacobins, for the heads they exact as a condition of
their departure,* or as the reward for their labours. The laurel
has no attraction for heroes like the&#383;e, who inve&#383;t
them&#383;elves with the baneful yew and inau&#383;picious
cypre&#383;s, and go to the field of honour with the dagger of the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in yet en&#383;anguined.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Many in&#383;i&#383;ted they would not depart until
after the death of the Queen&mdash;&#383;ome claimed the death of
one General, &#383;ome that of another, and all, the lives or
bani&#383;hment of the gentry and clergy.</blockquote>

<p>"Fair &#383;teeds, gay &#383;hields, bright arms," [Spencer.]
the fancy-created deity, the wreath of fame, and all that poets
have imagined to decorate the horrors of war, are not
nece&#383;&#383;ary to tempt the gro&#383;s barbarity of the
Pari&#383;ian: he &#383;eeks not glory, but carnage&mdash;his
incentive is the groans of defencele&#383;s victim&#383;&mdash;he

you that the prime mover of all the&#383;e machinations is your
omnipotent Mr. Pitt&mdash;it is he who has fomented the
perver&#383;ene&#383;s of the towns, and alarmed the timidity of
the village&#383;&mdash;he has per&#383;uaded &#383;ome that it is
not plea&#383;ant to leave their &#383;hops and families, and
in&#383;inuated into the minds of others that death or wounds are
not very de&#383;irable&mdash;he has, in fine, &#383;o effectually
achieved his purpo&#383;e, that the Convention i&#383;&#383;ues
decree after decree, the members harangue to little purpo&#383;e,
and the few recruits already levied, like tho&#383;e rai&#383;ed in
the &#383;pring, go from many places &#383;trongly e&#383;corted to
the army.&mdash;I wi&#383;h I had more peaceful and more agreeable
&#383;ubjects for your amu&#383;ement, but they do not pre&#383;ent
them&#383;elves, and "you mu&#383;t blame the times, not me." I
would wi&#383;h to tell you that the legi&#383;lature i&#383;
hone&#383;t, that the Jacobins are humane, and the people patriots;
but you know I have no talent for fiction, and if I had, my
&#383;ituation is not favourable to any effort of
fancy.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Peronne, Sept. 7, 1793.</h2>
<p>The &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es of the enemy on all &#383;ides, the
rebellion at Lyons and Mar&#383;eilles, with the increa&#383;ing
force of the in&#383;urgents in La Vendee, have revived our
eagerne&#383;s for news, and if the indifference of the French
character exempt them from more patriotic &#383;en&#383;ations, it
does not bani&#383;h curio&#383;ity; yet an eventful cri&#383;is,
which in England would draw people together, here keeps them apart.
When an important piece of intelligence arrives, our provincial
politicians &#383;hut them&#383;elves up with their gazettes,
&#383;hun &#383;ociety, and endeavour to avoid giving an opinion
until they are certain of the &#383;trength of a party, or the
&#383;ucce&#383;s of an attempt. In the pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of
public affairs, you may therefore conceive we have very little
communication&mdash;we expre&#383;s our &#383;entiment&#383; more
by looks and ge&#383;tures than words, and Lavater (admitting his
&#383;y&#383;tem) would be of more u&#383;e to a &#383;tranger than
Boyer or Chambaud. If the Engli&#383;h take Dunkirk, perhaps we may
be a little more &#383;ocial and more decided.</p>
<p>Mad. de ____ has a mo&#383;t exten&#383;ive acquaintance, and,
as we are &#383;ituated on one of the roads from Paris to the
northern army, notwith&#383;tanding the cautious policy of the
moment, we are tolerably well informed of what pa&#383;&#383;es in
mo&#383;t parts of France; and I cannot but be
a&#383;toni&#383;hed, when I combine all I hear, that the
government is able to &#383;u&#383;tain it&#383;elf. Want,
di&#383;cord, and rebellion, a&#383;&#383;ail it
within&mdash;defeats and lo&#383;&#383;es from without. Perhaps the
&#383;olution of this political problem can only be found in the
&#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s of the French character, and the want of
connection between the different departments. Thus one part of the
country is &#383;ubdued by means of another: the inhabitants of the
South take up arms in defence of their freedom and their commerce,
while tho&#383;e of the North refu&#383;e to countenance or
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t them, and wait in &#383;elfi&#383;h
tranquillity till the &#383;ame oppre&#383;&#383;ion is extended to
them&#383;elves. The majority of the people have no point of union
nor mode of communication, while the Jacobins, who&#383;e numbers
are comparatively in&#383;ignificant, are &#383;trong, by means of
their general corre&#383;pondence, their common center at Paris,
and the exclu&#383;ive direction of all the public prints. But,
whatever are the cau&#383;es, it is certain that the government is
at once powerful and dete&#383;ted&mdash;almo&#383;t without
apparent &#383;upport, yet difficult to overthrow; and the
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion of Rome to a dotard and a boy can no
longer excite the wonder of any one who reflects on what
pa&#383;&#383;es in France.</p>
<p>After various decrees to effect the levee en ma&#383;&#383;e,
the Convention have di&#383;covered that this &#383;ublime and
undefined project was not calculated for the pre&#383;ent
exhau&#383;ted &#383;tate of martial ardour. They therefore no
longer pre&#383;ume on any movement of enthu&#383;ia&#383;m, but
have made a po&#383;itive and &#383;pecific requi&#383;ition of all
the male inhabitants of France between eighteen and twenty-five
years of age. This, as might be expected, ha&#383; been more
effectual, becau&#383;e it intere&#383;ts tho&#383;e that are
exempt to force the compliance of tho&#383;e who are not. Our young
men here were like children with a medicine&mdash;they
propo&#383;ed fir&#383;t one form of taking thi&#383; military
potion, then another, and finding them all equally unpalatable,
would not, but for a little &#383;alutary force, have decided at
all.</p>
<p>A new law has been pa&#383;&#383;ed for arre&#383;ting all the
Engli&#383;h who cannot produce two witne&#383;&#383;es of their
civi&#383;me, and tho&#383;e who&#383;e conduct is thu&#383;
guaranteed are to receive tickets of ho&#383;pitality, which they
are to wear as a protection. This decree has not yet been carried
into effect at Peronne, nor am I much di&#383;turbed about it. Few
of our countrymen will find the matter very difficult to arrange,
and I believe they have all a better protection in the
di&#383;po&#383;ition of the people towards them, than any that can
be a&#383;&#383;ured them by decrees of the Convention.</p>
<p>Sept. 11. The news of Lord Hood's taking
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of Toulon, which the government
affected to di&#383;credit for &#383;ome days, is now
a&#383;certained; and the Convention, in a paroxi&#383;m of rage,
at once cowardly and unprincipled, has decreed that all the
Engli&#383;h not re&#383;ident in France before 1789, &#383;hall be
impri&#383;oned as ho&#383;tages, and be an&#383;werable with their
lives for the conduct of their countrymen and of the Toulone&#383;e
towards Bayle and Beauvais, two Deputies, &#383;aid to be detained
in the town at the time of its &#383;urrender. My fir&#383;t
emotions of terror and indignation have &#383;ub&#383;ided, and I
have, by packing up my clothes, di&#383;po&#383;ing of my papers,
and providing my&#383;elf with money, prepared for the wor&#383;t.
My friends, indeed, per&#383;uade me, (as on a former
occa&#383;ion,) that the decree is too atrocious to be put in
execution; but my apprehen&#383;ions are founded on a principle not
likely to deceive me&mdash;namely, that tho&#383;e who have
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed them&#383;elves of the French
government are capable of any thing. I live in con&#383;tant fear,
watching all day and li&#383;tening all night, and never go to bed
but with the expectation of being awakened, nor ri&#383;e without a
pre&#383;entiment of mi&#383;fortune.&mdash;I have not &#383;pirits
nor compo&#383;ure to write, and &#383;hall di&#383;continue my
letters until I am relieved from &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e, if nor
from unea&#383;ine&#383;s. I ri&#383;k much by pre&#383;erving
the&#383;e papers, and, perhaps, may never be able to add to them;
but whatever I may be re&#383;erved for, while I have a hope they
may reach you they &#383;hall not be de&#383;troyed. &mdash;I bid
you adieu in a &#383;tate of mind which the circum&#383;tances I am
under will de&#383;cribe better than words.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Mai&#383;on d'Arret, Arras, Oct. 15, 1793.</h2>
<p>Dear Brother,</p>
<p>The fears of a timid mind u&#383;ually magnify expected evil,
and anticipated &#383;uffering often dimini&#383;hes the effect of
an apprehended blow; yet my imagination had &#383;ugge&#383;ted
le&#383;s than I have experienced, nor do I find that a preparatory
&#383;tate of anxiety has rendered affliction more
&#383;upportable. The la&#383;t month of my life has been a
compendium of mi&#383;ery; and my recollection, which on every
other &#383;ubject &#383;eems to fail me, is, on this, but too
faithful, and will enable me to relate events which will
intere&#383;t you not only as they per&#383;onally concern me, but
as they pre&#383;ent a picture of the barbarity and
de&#383;poti&#383;m to which this whole country i&#383;
&#383;ubject, and to which many thou&#383;ands be&#383;ides
my&#383;elf were at the &#383;ame in&#383;tant victims.</p>
<p>A few evenings after I concluded my la&#383;t, the firing of
cannon and ringing the great bell announced the arrival of Dumont
(&#383;till Repre&#383;entative en mi&#383;&#383;ion in our
department). The town was immediately in alarm, all the gates were
&#383;hut, and the avenues leading to the ramparts guarded by
dragoons. Our hou&#383;e being in a di&#383;tant and unfrequented
&#383;treet, before we could learn the cau&#383;e of all thi&#383;
confu&#383;ion, a party of the national guard, with a municipal
officer at their head, arrived, to e&#383;cort Mad. de ___ and
my&#383;elf to a church, where the Repre&#383;entant was then
examining the pri&#383;oners brought before him. Almo&#383;t as
much a&#383;toni&#383;hed as terrified, we endeavoured to procure
&#383;ome information of our conductors, as to what was to be the
re&#383;ult of thi&#383; mea&#383;ure; but they knew nothing, and
it was ea&#383;y to perceive they thought the office they were
executing an unplea&#383;ant one. The &#383;treets we
pa&#383;&#383;ed were crouded with people, who&#383;e &#383;ilent
con&#383;ternation and di&#383;mayed countenances increa&#383;ed
our forebodings, and depre&#383;&#383;ed the little courage we had
yet pre&#383;erved. The church at our arrival was nearly empty, and
Dumont preparing to depart, when the municipal officer introduced
us to him. As &#383;oon as he learned that Mad. de ____ was the
&#383;i&#383;ter of an emigrant, and my&#383;elf a native of
England, he told us we were to pa&#383;s the night in a church
appointed for the purpo&#383;e, and that on the morrow we
&#383;hould be conveyed to Arras. For a moment all my faculties
became &#383;u&#383;pended, and it was only by an effort
almo&#383;t convul&#383;ive that I was able to a&#383;k how long it
was probable we &#383;hould be deprived of our liberty. He
&#383;aid he did not know&mdash;"but that the rai&#383;ing of the
&#383;iege of Dunkirk, and the lo&#383;s of &#383;ix thou&#383;and
troops which the French had taken pri&#383;oners, would
doubtle&#383;s produce an in&#383;urrection in England, par
con&#383;equent a peace, and our relea&#383;e from captivity!"</p>
<p>You may be a&#383;&#383;ured I felt no de&#383;ire of freedom on
&#383;uch terms, and &#383;hould have heard this ignorant and
malicious &#383;ugge&#383;tion only with contempt, had not the
implication it conveyed that our detention would not terminate but
with the war overwhelmed every other idea. Mad. de ____ then
petitioned that we might, on account of our health, (for we were
both really unwell,) be permitted to go home for the night,
accompanied by guards if it were thought nece&#383;&#383;ary. But
the Repre&#383;entant wa&#383; inexorable, and in a brutal and
de&#383;potic tone ordered us away.&mdash;When we reached the
church, which was to be our pri&#383;on till morning, we found
about an hundred and fifty people, chiefly old men, women, and
children, di&#383;per&#383;ed in melancholy groupes, lamenting
their &#383;ituation, and imparting their fears to each other. The
gloom of the building was increa&#383;ed by the darkne&#383;s of
the night; and the noi&#383;e of the guard, may of whom were
intoxicated, the odour of tobacco, and the heat of the place,
rendered our &#383;ituation almo&#383;t in&#383;upportable. We
&#383;oon di&#383;covered &#383;everal of our acquaintance, but
this a&#383;&#383;ociation in di&#383;tre&#383;s was far from
con&#383;olatory, and we pa&#383;&#383;ed the time in wandering
about together, and con&#383;ulting upon what would be of mo&#383;t
u&#383;e to us in our confinement. We had, indeed, little to hope
for from the morrow, yet the hours dragged on heavily, and I know
not if ever I beheld the return of light with more plea&#383;ure. I
was not without apprehen&#383;ion for our per&#383;onal
&#383;afety. I recollected the ma&#383;&#383;acres in churches at
Paris, and the frequent propo&#383;itions that had been made to
exterminate the gentry and clergy. Mad. de ____ has &#383;ince
confe&#383;&#383;ed, that &#383;he had the &#383;ame ideas.</p>
<p>Morning at length came, and our &#383;ervants were permitted to
enter with breakfa&#383;t. They appeared &#383;orrowful and
terror-&#383;tricken, but offered with great willingne&#383;s to
accompany us whither&#383;oever we &#383;hould be &#383;ent. After
a melancholy &#383;ort of di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion, it was decided
that we &#383;hould take our femmes de chambres, and that the
others &#383;hould remain for the &#383;afety of the hou&#383;e,
and to &#383;end us what we might have occa&#383;ion for. This
&#383;ettled, they returned with &#383;uch directions as we were
able to give them, (God knows, not very coherent ones,) to prepare
for our journey: and as our orders, however confu&#383;ed, were not
very voluminous, they were &#383;oon executed, and before noon
every thing was in readine&#383;s for our departure. The people
employed by our companions were equally diligent, and we might very
well have &#383;et out by one o'clock, had our ca&#383;e been at
all con&#383;idered; but, I know not why, in&#383;tead of &#383;o
providing that we might reach our de&#383;tination in the
cour&#383;e of the day, it &#383;eemed to have been purpo&#383;ely
contrived that we &#383;hould be all night on the road, though we
had already pa&#383;&#383;ed one night without re&#383;t, and were
exhau&#383;ted by watching and fatigue.</p>
<p>In this uncertain and unplea&#383;ant &#383;tate we waited till
near &#383;ix o'clock; a number of &#383;mall covered waggons were
then brought, accompanied by a detachment of dragoons, who were to
be our e&#383;cort. Some time elap&#383;ed, a&#383; you may
&#383;uppo&#383;e, before we could be all &#383;ettled in the
carriages and &#383;uch a cavalcade put in motion; but the
concour&#383;e of people that filled the &#383;treets, the
appearance of the troops, and the tumult occa&#383;ioned by &#383;o
many hor&#383;es and carriages, overpowered my &#383;pirits, and I
remember little of what pa&#383;&#383;ed till I found we were on
the road to Arras. Mad. de ____'&#383; maid now informed us, that
Dumont had arrived the evening before in extreme ill humour,
&#383;ummoned the municipality in ha&#383;te, enquired how many
people they had arre&#383;ted, and what denunciations they had yet
to make. The whole body corporate trembled, they had arre&#383;ted
no one, and, &#383;till wor&#383;e, they had no one to accu&#383;e;
and could only alledge in their behalf, that the town was in the
utmo&#383;t tranquillity, and the people were &#383;o well
di&#383;po&#383;ed, that all violence was unnece&#383;&#383;ary.
The Repre&#383;entant became furious, vociferated <i>tout
gro&#383;&#383;ierement a la Francai&#383;e,</i> [In the vulgar
French manner.] that he knew there were five thou&#383;and
ari&#383;tocrates in Peronne, and that if he had not at lea&#383;t
five hundred brought him before morning, he would declare the town
in a &#383;tate of rebellion.</p>
<p>Alarmed by this menace, they began to arre&#383;t with all
po&#383;&#383;ible &#383;peed, and were more &#383;olicitous to
procure their number than to make di&#383;criminations. Their
diligence, however, was inadequate to appea&#383;e the choleric
legi&#383;lator, and the Mayor, municipal officers, and all the
admini&#383;trators of the di&#383;trict, were in the morning
&#383;ent to the Ca&#383;tle, whence they are to be conveyed, with
&#383;ome of their own pri&#383;oners, to Amiens.</p>
<p>Be&#383;ides this intelligence, we learned that before our
&#383;ervants had fini&#383;hed packing up our trunks, &#383;ome
Commi&#383;&#383;ioners of the &#383;ection arrived to put the
&#383;eals on every thing belonging to us, and it was not without
much altercation that they con&#383;ented to our being
furni&#383;hed with nece&#383;&#383;arie&#383;&mdash;that they had
not only &#383;ealed up all the hou&#383;e, but had placed guards
there, each of whom Mad. de ____ is to pay, at the rate of two
&#383;hillings a day.</p>
<p>We were too large a body to travel fa&#383;t, and by the time we
reached Bapaume (though only fifteen miles) it was after twelve; it
rained dreadfully, the night was extremely dark, the roads were
bad, and the hor&#383;es tired; &#383;o that the officer who
conducted us thought it would be difficult to proceed before
morning. We were therefore once more crouded into a church, in our
wet clothes, (for the covering of the waggon wa&#383; not thick
enough to exclude the rain,) a few bundles of damp &#383;traw were
di&#383;tributed, and we were then &#383;hut up to repo&#383;e as
well as we could. All my melancholy apprehen&#383;ions of the
preceding night returned with accumulated force, e&#383;pecially as
we were now in a place where we were unknown, and were guarded by
&#383;ome of the newly-rai&#383;ed dragoons, of whom we all
entertained very unfavourable &#383;u&#383;picions.</p>
<p>We did not, as you may well imagine, attempt to
&#383;leep&mdash;a bed of wet &#383;traw laid on the pavement of a
church, filthy, as mo&#383;t French churches are, and the fear of
being a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inated, re&#383;i&#383;ted every
effort of nature her&#383;elf, and we were very glad when at the
break of day we were &#383;ummoned to continue our journey. About
eleven we entered Arras: the &#383;treets were filled by idle
people, apprized of our arrival; but no one offered us any
in&#383;ult, except &#383;ome &#383;oldiers, (I believe, by their
uniform, refugees from the Netherlands,) who cried, "a la
Guillotine!&mdash;a la Guillotine!"</p>
<p>The place to which we were ordered had been the hou&#383;e of an
emigrant, now converted into an hou&#383;e of detention, and which,
though large, wa&#383; exce&#383;&#383;ively full. The keeper, on
our being delivered to him, declared he had no room for us, and we
remained with our baggage in the court-yard &#383;ome hours before
he had, by di&#383;lodging and compre&#383;&#383;ing the other
inhabitants, contrived to place us. At la&#383;t, when we were half
dead with cold and fatigue, we were &#383;hown to our quarters.
Tho&#383;e allotted for my friend, my&#383;elf, and our
&#383;ervants, was the corner of a garret without a cieling, cold
enough in it&#383;elf, but rendered much warmer than wa&#383;
de&#383;irable by the effluvia of a &#383;core of living bodies,
who did not &#383;eem to think the unplea&#383;antne&#383;s of
their &#383;ituation at all increa&#383;ed by dirt and
offen&#383;ive &#383;mells. Weary as we were, it was
impo&#383;&#383;ible to attempt repo&#383;ing until a purification
had been effected: we therefore &#383;et our&#383;elves to
&#383;prinkling vinegar and burning perfumes; and it was
curiou&#383; to ob&#383;erve that the people, (<i>all gens comme il
faut</i> [People of fa&#383;hion.]) whom we found inhaling the
atmo&#383;phere of a Caffrarian hut, declared their nerves were
incommoded by the e&#383;&#383;ence of ro&#383;es and vinaigre des
quatre voleurs.</p>
<p>As a part of the room was occupied by men, our next
bu&#383;ine&#383;s was to &#383;eparate our corner by a curtain,
which we had fortunately brought with our bedding; and this done,
we &#383;pread our mattre&#383;&#383;es and lay down, while the
&#383;ervants were employed in getting us tea. As &#383;oon as we
were a little refre&#383;hed, and the room was quiet for the night,
we made up our beds as well as we could, and endeavoured to
&#383;leep. Mad. de ____ and the two maids &#383;oon forgot their
cares; but, though worn out by fatigue, the agitation of my mind
conquered the di&#383;po&#383;ition of my body. I &#383;eemed to
have lo&#383;t the very faculty of &#383;leeping, and
pa&#383;&#383;ed this night with almo&#383;t as little repo&#383;e
as the two preceding ones. Before morning I di&#383;covered that
remaining &#383;o long in damp clothes, and the other
circum&#383;tances of our journey, had given me cold, and that I
had all the &#383;ymptoms of a violent fever.</p>
<p>I leave you to conjecture, for it would be impo&#383;&#383;ible
to detail, all the mi&#383;ery of illne&#383;s in &#383;uch a
&#383;ituation; and I will only add, that by the care of Mad. de
____, who&#383;e health was happily le&#383;s affected, and the
attention of my maid, I was able to leave the room in about three
weeks. &mdash;I mu&#383;t now &#383;ecrete this for &#383;ome days,
but will hereafter re&#383;ume my little narrative, and explain how
I have ventured to write &#383;o much even in the very
neighbourhood of the Guillotine.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h2>Mai&#383;on d'Arret, Arras, Oct. 17, 1793.</h2>
<p>On the night I concluded my la&#383;t, a report that
Commi&#383;&#383;ioners were to vi&#383;it the hou&#383;e on the
morrow obliged me to di&#383;po&#383;e of my papers beyond the
po&#383;&#383;ibility of their being found. The alarm is now over,
and I proceed.&mdash;After &#383;omething more than three weeks
indi&#383;po&#383;ition, I began to walk in the yard, and make
acquaintance with our fellow-pri&#383;oners. Mad. de ____ had
already di&#383;covered &#383;everal that were known to her, and I
now found, with much regret, that many of my Arras friends were
here al&#383;o. Having been arre&#383;ted &#383;ome days before us,
they were rather more conveniently lodged, and taking the
wretchedne&#383;s of our garret into con&#383;ideration, it was
agreed that Mad. de ____ &#383;hould move to a room le&#383;&#383;
crouded than our own, and a dark clo&#383;et that would ju&#383;t
contain my mattre&#383;&#383;es was re&#383;igned to me. It is
indeed a very &#383;orry apartment, but as it promi&#383;es me a
refuge where I may &#383;ometimes read or write in peace, I have
taken po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of it very thankfully. A lock
on the door is not the lea&#383;t of its recommendations, and by
way of &#383;ecuring my&#383;elf again&#383;t all &#383;urprize, I
have contrived an additional fa&#383;tening by means of a large
nail and the chain of a portmanteau&mdash;I have likewi&#383;e,
under pretext of keeping out the wind, papered over the cracks of
the door, and provided my&#383;elf with a &#383;and-bag, &#383;o
that no one can perceive when I have a light later than
u&#383;ual.&mdash;With the&#383;e precautions, I can amu&#383;e
my&#383;elf by putting on paper any little occurrences that I think
worth pre&#383;erving, without much danger, and perhaps the details
of a &#383;ituation &#383;o new and &#383;o &#383;trange may not be
unintere&#383;ting to you.</p>
<p>We are now about three hundred in number of both &#383;exes, and
of all age&#383; and condition&#383;&mdash;ci-devant
noble&#383;&#383;e, parents, wives, &#383;i&#383;ters, and other
relations of emigrant&#383;&mdash;prie&#383;ts who have not taken
the oaths, merchant&#383; and &#383;hopkeepers accu&#383;ed of
monopoly, nuns, farmers that are &#383;aid to have concealed their
corn, mi&#383;erable women, with &#383;carcely clothes to cover
them, for not going to the con&#383;titutional ma&#383;s, and many
only becau&#383;e they happened to be at an inn, or on a vi&#383;it
from their own town, when a general arre&#383;t took place of all
who are what is called etrangers, that is to &#383;ay, not
foreigners only, but not inhabitants of the town where they are
found.&mdash;There are, be&#383;ides, various de&#383;criptions of
people &#383;ent here on &#383;ecret informations, and who do not
them&#383;elves know the preci&#383;e rea&#383;on of their
confinement. I imagine we are &#383;ubject to nearly the &#383;ame
rules as the common pri&#383;ons: no one is permitted to enter or
&#383;peak to a "detenu" but at the gate, and in pre&#383;ence of
the guard; and all letters, parcels, ba&#383;kets, &amp;c. are
examined previous to their being either conveyed from hence or
received. This, however, depends much on the political principles
of tho&#383;e who happen to be on guard: an ari&#383;tocrate or a
con&#383;titutionali&#383;t will read a letter with his eyes half
&#383;hut, and in&#383;pect bedding and trunks in a very
&#383;ummary way; while a thorough-paced republican &#383;pells
every &#383;yllable of the longe&#383;t epi&#383;tle, and opens all
the roa&#383;ted pigs or duck-pies before he allows their
ingre&#383;s.&mdash;None of the &#383;ervants are &#383;uffered to
go out, &#383;o that tho&#383;e who have not friend&#383; in the
town to procure them nece&#383;&#383;aries are obliged to depend
entirely on the keeper, and, of cour&#383;e, pay extravagantly dear
for every thing; but we are &#383;o much in the power of the&#383;e
people, that it is prudent to &#383;ubmit to &#383;uch
impo&#383;itions without murmuring.</p>
<p>I did not, during my illne&#383;s, read the papers, and have
to-day been amu&#383;ing my&#383;elf with a large packet. General
Houchard, I find, i&#383; arre&#383;ted, for not having, as they
&#383;ay he might have done, driven all the Engli&#383;h army into
the &#383;ea, after rai&#383;ing the &#383;iege of Dunkirk; yet a
few weeks ago their utmo&#383;t hopes &#383;carcely amounted to the
relief of the town: but their fears having &#383;ub&#383;ided, they
have now lei&#383;ure to be jealous; and I know no &#383;ituation
&#383;o little to be envied under the pre&#383;ent government as
that of a &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful General.&mdash;Among all their
important avocations, the Convention have found time to pa&#383;s a
decree for obliging women to wear the national cockade, under pain
of impri&#383;onment; and the municipality of the &#383;uperb Paris
have ordered that the King's family &#383;hall, in future, u&#383;e
pewter &#383;poons and eat brown bread!</p>

<h2>Oct. 18.</h2>
<p>I begin to be very unea&#383;y about Mr. and Mrs. D____. I have
written &#383;everal times, and &#383;till receive no an&#383;wer.
I fear they are in a confinement more &#383;evere than my own, or
that our letters mi&#383;carry. A &#383;ervant of Mad. de ____'s
was here this morning, and no letters had come to Peronne,
unle&#383;s, as my friend endeavours to per&#383;uade me, the man
would not venture to give them in pre&#383;ence of the guard, who
par excellence happened to be a furious Jacobin.&mdash;We had the
mortification of hearing that a very elegant carriage of Mad. de
____'s has been put in requi&#383;ition, and taken to convey a
tinman and two farriers who were going to Paris on a
mi&#383;&#383;ion&mdash;that two of her farmer's be&#383;t
hor&#383;es had been killed by hard work in taking provi&#383;ions
to the army, and that they are now cutting down the young wood on
her e&#383;tate to make pikes.&mdash;The &#383;eal&#383; are
&#383;till on our effects, and the guard remains in
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion, which ha&#383; put us to the
expence of buying a variety of articles we could not well
di&#383;pen&#383;e with: for, on examining the baggage after our
arrival, we found it very much dimin&#383;hed; and this has
happened to almo&#383;t all the people who have been arre&#383;ted.
Our &#383;u&#383;picions naturally fall on the dragoons, and it is
not very &#383;urprizing that they &#383;hould attempt to
&#383;teal from tho&#383;e whom they are certain would not dare to
make any complaint.</p>
<p>Many of our fellow-pri&#383;oners are embarra&#383;&#383;ed by
their &#383;ervants having quitted them.&mdash;One Collot
d'Herbois, a member of the Commite de Salut Public, has
propo&#383;ed to the Convention to collect all the gentry,
prie&#383;ts, and &#383;u&#383;pected people, into different
buildings, which &#383;hould be previou&#383;ly mined for the
purpo&#383;e, and, on the lea&#383;t appearance of
in&#383;urrection, to blow them up all together.&mdash;You may
perhaps conclude, that &#383;uch a project was received with
horror, and the advi&#383;er of it treated as a mon&#383;ter. Our
humane legi&#383;lature, however, very coolly &#383;ent it to the
committee to be di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed, without any regard to the
terror and apprehen&#383;ion which the bare idea of a &#383;imilar
propo&#383;al mu&#383;t in&#383;pire in tho&#383;e who are the
de&#383;tined victims. I cannot my&#383;elf believe that thi&#383;
abominable &#383;cheme is intended for execution, but it has
neverthele&#383;&#383; created much alarm in timid minds, and has
occa&#383;ioned in part the defection of the &#383;ervants I have
ju&#383;t mentioned. Tho&#383;e who were &#383;ufficiently attached
to their ma&#383;ters and mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es to endure the
confinement and privations of a Mai&#383;on d'Arret, tremble at the
thought&#383; of being involved in the common ruin of a gunpowder
explo&#383;ion; and the men &#383;eem to have le&#383;s courage
than the women, at lea&#383;t more of the latter have
con&#383;ented to remain here.&mdash;It was atrocious to
publi&#383;h &#383;uch a conception, though nothing perhaps was
intended by it, as it may deprive many people of faithful
attendants at a time when they are mo&#383;t
nece&#383;&#383;ary.</p>
<p>We have a tribunal revolutionnaire here, with its u&#383;ual
attendant the Guillotine, and executions are now become very
frequent. I know not who are the &#383;ufferers, and avoid
enquiring through fear of hearing the name of &#383;ome
acquaintance. As far as I can learn, the trials are but too
&#383;ummary, and little other evidence is required than the
fortune, rank, and connections of the accu&#383;ed. The Deputy who
is Commi&#383;&#383;ioner for thi&#383; department is one Le Bon,
formerly a prie&#383;t&mdash;and, I under&#383;tand, of an immoral
and &#383;anguinary character, and that it is he who chiefly
direct&#383; the verdicts of the juries according to his
per&#383;onal hatred or hi&#383; per&#383;onal
intere&#383;t.&mdash;We have lately had a very melancholy
in&#383;tance of the terror created by this tribunal, as well as of
the notions that prevail of its ju&#383;tice. A gentleman of
Calais, who had an employ under the government, was accu&#383;ed of
&#383;ome irregularity in his accounts, and, in con&#383;equence,
put under arre&#383;t. The affair became &#383;erious, and he
wa&#383; ordered to pri&#383;on, as a preliminary to his trial.
When the officer&#383; entered his apartment to take him, regarding
the judicial procedure as a mere form, and concluding it was
determined to &#383;acrifice him, he in a frenzy of de&#383;pair
&#383;eized the dogs in the chimney, threw them at the people, and,
while they e&#383;caped to call for a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance,
de&#383;troyed him&#383;elf by cutting his arteries.&mdash;It has
appeared, &#383;ince the death of thi&#383; unfortunate man, that
the charge again&#383;t him was groundle&#383;s, and that he only
wanted time to arrange his papers, in order to exonerate
him&#383;elf entirely.</p>

<h2>Oct. 19.</h2>
<p>We are di&#383;turbed almo&#383;t nightly by the arrival of
fre&#383;h pri&#383;oners, and my fir&#383;t que&#383;tion of a
morning is always <i>"N'e&#383;t il pas du monde entre la
nuit?"</i>&mdash;Angelique's u&#383;ual reply is a groan, and
<i>"Ah, mon Dieu, oui;" "Une dixaine de pretres;"</i> or, <i>"Une
trentaine de nobles:"</i> ["Did not &#383;ome people arrive in the
night?"]&mdash;"Yes, God help u&#383;&mdash;half a &#383;core
prie&#383;ts, or twenty or thirty gentry." And I ob&#383;erve the
depth of the groan is nearly in proportion to the quality of the
per&#383;on &#383;he commi&#383;erates. Thus, a groan for a Comte,
a Marqui&#383;e, or a Prie&#383;t, is much more audible than one
for a &#383;imple gentlewoman or a merchant; and the arrival of a
Bi&#383;hop (e&#383;pecially if not one of the con&#383;titutional
clergy) is announced in a more &#383;orrowful key than either.</p>
<p>While I was walking in the yard this morning, I was
acco&#383;ted by a female whom I immediately recollected to be
Victoire, a very pretty <i>couturiere,</i> [Semp&#383;tre&#383;s.]
who u&#383;ed to work for me when I was at Panthemont, and who made
your la&#383;t holland &#383;hirts. I was not a little
&#383;urprized to &#383;ee her in &#383;uch a &#383;ituation, and
took her a&#383;ide to enquire her hi&#383;tory. I found that her
mother was dead, and that her brother having &#383;et up a little
&#383;hop at St. Omer, had engaged her to go and live with him.
Being under five-and-twenty, the la&#383;t requi&#383;ition obliged
him to depart for the army, and leave her to carry on the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s alone. Three weeks after, &#383;he was
arre&#383;ted at midnight, put into a cart, and brought hither. She
had no time to take any precautions, and their little commerce,
which was in haberda&#383;hery, as well as &#383;ome work &#383;he
had in hand, is abandoned to the mercy of the people that
arre&#383;ted her. She has rea&#383;on to &#383;uppo&#383;e that
her crime con&#383;i&#383;ts in not having frequented the
con&#383;titutional ma&#383;s; and that her accu&#383;er is a
member of one of the town committees, who, &#383;ince her brother's
ab&#383;ence, has per&#383;ecuted her with di&#383;honourable
propo&#383;als, and, having been repul&#383;ed, has taken thi&#383;
method of revenging him&#383;elf. Her conjecture is mo&#383;t
probably right, as, &#383;ince her impri&#383;onment, this man has
been endeavouring to make a &#383;ort of barter with her for her
relea&#383;e.</p>
<p>I am really concerned for this poor creature, who is at
pre&#383;ent a very good girl, but if &#383;he remain here &#383;he
will not only be deprived of her means of living, but perhaps her
morals may be irremediably corrupted. She is now lodged in a room
with ten or dozen men, and the hou&#383;e is &#383;o crouded that I
doubt whether I have intere&#383;t enough to procure her a more
decent apartment.</p>
<p>What can this &#383;trange policy tend to, that thus
expo&#383;es to ruin and want a girl of one-and-twenty&mdash;not
for any open violation of the law, but merely for her religious
opinions; and this, too, in a country which profe&#383;&#383;es
toleration as the ba&#383;is of its government?</p>
<p>My friend, Mad. de ____ &#383;'ennui terribly; &#383;he is not
incapable of amu&#383;ing her&#383;elf, but is here deprived of the
means. We have no corner we can call our own to &#383;it in, and no
retreat when we wi&#383;h to be out of a croud except my
clo&#383;et, where we can only &#383;ee by candle-light.
Be&#383;ides, &#383;he regrets her employments, and projects for
the winter. She had begun painting a St. There&#383;a, and
tran&#383;lating an Italian romance, and had nearly completed the
education of a dozen canary birds, who would in a month's time have
accompanied the harp &#383;o delightfully, as to overpower the
&#383;ound of the in&#383;trument. I believe if we had a few more
&#383;quare inches of room, &#383;he would be tempted, if not to
bring the whole chorus, at lea&#383;t to con&#383;ole her&#383;elf
with two particular favourites, di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by curious
topknots, and rings about their necks.</p>
<p>With all the&#383;e feminine propen&#383;ities, &#383;he is very
amiable, and her ca&#383;e is indeed &#383;ingularly cruel and
unju&#383;t.&mdash;Left, at an early age, under the care of her
brother, &#383;he was placed by him at Panthemont (where I
fir&#383;t became acquainted with her) with an intention of having
her per&#383;uaded to take the veil; but finding her aver&#383;e
from a cloi&#383;ter, &#383;he remained as a pen&#383;ioner only,
till a very advantageous marriage with the Marquis de ____, who was
old enough to be her father, procured her relea&#383;e. About two
years ago he died, and left her a very con&#383;iderable fortune,
which the revolution has reduced to nearly one-third of its former
value. The Comte de ____, her brother, was one of the original
patriots, and embraced with great warmth the cau&#383;e of the
people; but having very narrowly e&#383;caped the
ma&#383;&#383;acres of September, 1792, he immediately after
emigrated.</p>
<p>Thus, my poor friend, immured by her brother till the age of
twenty-two in a convent, then &#383;acrificed three years to a
hu&#383;band of a di&#383;agreeable temper and un&#383;uitable age,
is now deprived of the fir&#383;t liberty &#383;he ever enjoyed,
and is made an&#383;werable for the conduct of a man over whom
&#383;he has no &#383;ort of influence. It is not, therefore,
extraordinary that &#383;he cannot reconcile her&#383;elf to her
pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation, and I am really often more concerned
on her account than my own. Cut off from her u&#383;ual
re&#383;ources, &#383;he has no amu&#383;ement but wandering about
the hou&#383;e; and if her other cau&#383;es of
unea&#383;ine&#383;s be not augmented, they are at lea&#383;t
rendered more intolerable by her inability to fill up her
time.&mdash;This does not ari&#383;e from a deficiency of
under&#383;tanding, but from never having been accu&#383;tomed to
think. Her mind re&#383;embles a body that is weak, not by nature,
but from want of exerci&#383;e; and the number of years &#383;he
has pa&#383;&#383;ed in a convent has given her that mixture of
childi&#383;hne&#383;s and romance, which, my making frivolities
nece&#383;&#383;ary, renders the mind incapable of exertion or
&#383;elf-&#383;upport.</p>

<h2>Oct. 20.</h2>
<p>The unfortunate Queen, after a trial of &#383;ome days, during
which &#383;he &#383;eem&#383; to have behaved with great dignity
and fortitude, is no longer &#383;en&#383;ible of the regrets of
her friends or the malice of her enemies. It i&#383; &#383;ingular,
that I have not yet heard her death mentioned in the pri&#383;on
&mdash;every one looks grave and affects &#383;ilence. I believe
her death has not occa&#383;ioned an effect &#383;o univer&#383;al
as that of the King, and whatever people's opinions may be, they
are afraid of expre&#383;&#383;ing them: for it i&#383; &#383;aid,
though I know not with what truth, that we are &#383;urrounded by
&#383;pies, and &#383;everal who have the appearance of being
pri&#383;oners like our&#383;elve&#383; have been pointed out to me
as the objects of this &#383;u&#383;picion.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to undertake the defence of the Queen's imputed
fault&#383;&mdash; yet I think there are &#383;ome at lea&#383;t
which one may be very fairly permitted to doubt.
Compa&#383;&#383;ion &#383;hould not make me an advocate for guilt
&mdash;but I may, without &#383;acrificing morals to pity, venture
to ob&#383;erve, that the many &#383;candalous hi&#383;tories
circulated to her prejudice took their ri&#383;e at the birth of
the Dauphin,* which formed &#383;o in&#383;urmountable a bar to the
views of the Duke of Orleans.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Nearly at the &#383;ame time, and on the &#383;ame
occa&#383;ion, there were literary partizans of the Duke of
Orleans, who endeavoured to per&#383;uade the people that the man
with the iron ma&#383;k, who had &#383;o long excited
curio&#383;ity and eluded conjecture, was the real &#383;on of
Loui&#383; XIII.&mdash;and Louis XIV. in con&#383;equence,
&#383;uppo&#383;ititious, and only the illegitimate off&#383;pring
of Cardinal Mazarin and Anne of Au&#383;tria&mdash;that the
&#383;pirit of ambition and intrigue which characterized thi&#383;
Mini&#383;ter had &#383;ugge&#383;ted this &#383;ub&#383;titution
to the lawful heir, and that the fears of the Queen and
confu&#383;ion of the times had obliged her to acquie&#383;ce:
"Cette opinion ridicule, et dont les dates connues de
l'hi&#383;toire demontrent l'ab&#383;urdite, avoit eu des
parti&#383;ans en France&mdash;elle tendoit a avilir la mai&#383;on
regnante, et a per&#383;uader au peuple que le trone n'appartient
pas aux de&#383;cendans de Louis XIV. prince furtivement
&#383;ut&#383;titue, mais a la po&#383;terite du &#383;econd fils
de Loui&#383; XIII. qui e&#383;t la tige de la branche d'Orleans,
et qui e&#383;t reconnue comme de&#383;cendant legitimement, et
&#383;ans objection, du Roi Loui&#383; XIII." &mdash;Nouvelles
Con&#383;iderations &#383;ur la Ma&#383;que de Fer, Memoirs de
Richelieu. "This ridiculous opinion, the ab&#383;urdity of which is
demon&#383;trated by hi&#383;torical dates, had not been without
its partizans in France.&mdash;It tended to degrade the reigning
family, and to make the people believe that the throne did not of
right belong to the de&#383;cendant&#383; of Louis XIV. (a prince
&#383;urreptitiou&#383;ly intruded) but to the po&#383;terity of
the &#383;econd &#383;on of Louis XIII. from whom is derived the
branch of Orleans, and who was, without di&#383;pute, the
legitimate and unobjectionable off&#383;pring of Louis XIII."
&mdash;New Con&#383;iderations on the Iron Ma&#383;k.&mdash;Memoirs
of the Duc de Richelieu.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of the above Memoirs adds, that after the taking of
the Ba&#383;tille, new attempts were made to propagate this
opinion, and that he him&#383;elf had refuted it to many people, by
producing original letters and papers, &#383;ufficiently
demon&#383;trative of its ab&#383;urdity.</p>
<p>&mdash;He might hope, by popularity, to &#383;uper&#383;ede the
children of the Count d'Artois, who was hated; but an immediate
heir to the Crown could be removed only by throwing
&#383;u&#383;picions on his legitimacy. The&#383;e
preten&#383;ions, it is true, were &#383;o ab&#383;urd, and even
incredible, that had they been urged at the time, no inference in
the Queen's favour would have been admitted from them; but as the
exi&#383;tence of &#383;uch projects, however ab&#383;urd and
iniquitous, has &#383;ince been demon&#383;trated, one may now,
with great appearance of rea&#383;on, allow them &#383;ome weight
in her ju&#383;tification.</p>
<p>The affair of the necklace was of infinite di&#383;&#383;ervice
to the Queen'&#383; reputation; yet it is remarkable, that the
mo&#383;t furious of the Jacobin&#383; are &#383;ilent on this head
as far as it regarded her, and always mention the Cardinal de Rohan
in terms that &#383;uppo&#383;e him to be the culpable party: but,
"whatever her faults, her woes de&#383;erve compa&#383;&#383;ion;"
and perhaps the morali&#383;t, who is not too &#383;evere, may find
&#383;ome excu&#383;e for a Prince&#383;s, who, at the age of
&#383;ixteen, po&#383;&#383;ibly without one real friend or
di&#383;intere&#383;ted advi&#383;er, became the unre&#383;trained
idol of the mo&#383;t licentious Court in Europe. Even her enemies
do not pretend that her fate was &#383;o much a merited
puni&#383;hment as a political mea&#383;ure: they alledge, that
while her life was yet &#383;pared, the valour of their troop&#383;
was checked by the po&#383;&#383;ibility of negotiation; and that
being no more, neither the people nor armies expecting any thing
but execration or revenge, they will be more ready to proceed to
the mo&#383;t de&#383;perate extremities.&mdash;This you will think
a barbarous &#383;ort of policy, and con&#383;idering it as
national, it appears no le&#383;s ab&#383;urd than barbarous; but
for the Convention, who&#383;e views perhaps extend little farther
than to &#383;aving their heads, peculating, and receiving their
eighteen livres a day, &#383;uch mea&#383;ures, and &#383;uch a
principle of action, are neither unwi&#383;e nor unaccountable:
"for the wi&#383;dom of civilized nations is not their wi&#383;dom,
nor the ways of civilized people their ways."*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I have been informed, by a gentleman who &#383;aw the
Queen pa&#383;s in her way to execution, that the &#383;hort white
bed gown and the cap which &#383;he wore were di&#383;coloured by
&#383;moke, and that her whole appearance &#383;eemed to have been
intended, if po&#383;&#383;ible, to degrade her in the eyes of the
multitude. The benevolent mind will recollect with plea&#383;ure,
that even the Queen's enemies allow her a fortitude and energy of
character which mu&#383;t have counteracted this paltry malice, and
rendered it incapable of producing any emotion but contempt. On her
fir&#383;t being removed to the Conciergerie, &#383;he applied for
&#383;ome nece&#383;&#383;aries; but the humane municipality of
Paris refu&#383;ed them, under pretext that the demand was contrary
to the &#383;y&#383;tem of <i>la &#383;ainte
elagite</i>&mdash;"holy equality."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;It was reported that the Queen was offered her life, and
the liberty to retire to St. Cloud, her favourite re&#383;idence,
if &#383;he would engage the enemy to rai&#383;e the &#383;iege of
Maubeuge and withdraw; but that &#383;he refu&#383;ed to
interfere.</p>

<h2>Arras, 1793.</h2>
<p>For &#383;ome days previous to the battle by which Maubeuge was
relieved, we had very gloomy apprehen&#383;ions, and had the French
army been un&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful and forced to fall back, it
is not improbable but the lives of tho&#383;e detained in the
<i>Mai&#383;on d'Arret</i> [Hou&#383;e of detention.] might have
been &#383;acrificed under pretext of appea&#383;ing the people,
and to give &#383;ome credit to the &#383;u&#383;picions &#383;o
indu&#383;triou&#383;ly inculcated that all their defeats are
occa&#383;ioned by internal enemies. My fir&#383;t care, as
&#383;oon as I was able to go down &#383;tairs, was to examine if
the hou&#383;e offered any means of e&#383;cape in ca&#383;e of
danger, and I believe, if we could pre&#383;erve our recollection,
it might be practicable; but I can &#383;o little depend on my
&#383;trength and &#383;pirits, &#383;hould &#383;uch a
nece&#383;&#383;ity occur, that perhaps the con&#383;olation of
knowing I have a re&#383;ource is the only benefit I &#383;hould
ever derive from it.</p>

<h2>Oct. 21.</h2>
<p>I have this day made a di&#383;covery of a very unplea&#383;ant
nature, which Mad. de ____ had hitherto cautiou&#383;ly concealed
from me. All the Engli&#383;h, and other foreigners placed under
&#383;imilar circum&#383;tances, are now, without exception,
arre&#383;ted, and the confi&#383;cation of their property is
decreed. It is uncertain if the law is to extend to wearing
apparel, but I find that on this ground the Committee of Peronne
per&#383;i&#383;t in refu&#383;ing to take the &#383;eals off my
effects, or to permit my being &#383;upplied with any
nece&#383;&#383;aries what&#383;oever. In other places they have
put two, four, and, I am told, even to the number of &#383;ix
guards, in hou&#383;es belonging to the Engli&#383;h; and
the&#383;e guards, exclu&#383;ive of being paid each two
&#383;hillings per day, burn the wood, regale on the wine, and
pillage in detail all they can find, while the unfortunate owner is
&#383;tarving in a Mai&#383;on d'Arret, and cannot obtain
permi&#383;&#383;ion to withdraw a &#383;ingle article for his own
u&#383;e.&mdash;The plea for this paltry mea&#383;ure is, that,
according to the report of a de&#383;erter e&#383;caped from
Toulon, Lord Hood has hanged one Beauvais, a member of the
Convention. I have no doubt but the report is fal&#383;e, and,
mo&#383;t likely, fabricated by the Comite de Salut Public, in
order to palliate an act of inju&#383;tice previou&#383;ly
meditated.</p>
<p>It is needle&#383;s to expatiate on the atrocity of making
individuals, living here under the faith of the nation,
re&#383;pon&#383;ible for the events of the war, and it is
whi&#383;pered that even the people are a little a&#383;hamed of
it; yet the government are not &#383;ati&#383;fied with making us
accountable for what really does happen, but they attribute acts of
cruelty to our countrymen, in order to excu&#383;e tho&#383;e they
commit them&#383;elves, and retaliate imagined injuries by
&#383;ub&#383;tantial vengeance.&mdash;Legendre, a member of the
Convention, has propo&#383;ed, with a mo&#383;t benevolent
ingenuity, that the manes of the afore&#383;aid Beauvais
&#383;hould be appea&#383;ed by exhibiting Mr. Luttrell in an iron
cage for a convenient time, and then hanging him.</p>
<p>A gentleman from Amiens, lately arre&#383;ted while happening to
be here on bu&#383;ine&#383;s, informs me, that Mr. Luttrell is now
in the common gaol of that place, lodged with three other
per&#383;ons in a mi&#383;erable apartment, &#383;o &#383;mall,
that there is not room to pa&#383;s between their beds. I
under&#383;tand he was advi&#383;ed to petition Dumont for his
removal to a Mai&#383;on d'Arret, where he would have more external
convenience; but he rejected thi&#383; coun&#383;el, no doubt from
a di&#383;dain which did him honour, and preferred to &#383;uffer
all that the mean malice of the&#383;e wretches would inflict,
rather than a&#383;k any accommodation as a favour.&mdash;The
di&#383;tingui&#383;hing Mr. Luttrell from any other Engli&#383;h
gentleman is as much a proof of ignorance as of ba&#383;ene&#383;s;
but in this, as in every thing el&#383;e, the pre&#383;ent French
government is &#383;till more wicked than ab&#383;urd, and our
ridicule i&#383; &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed by our
dete&#383;tation.</p>

<h2>Oct. 22.</h2>
<p>Mad. de ____'s _homme d'affaire&#383;_ [Agent] has been here
to-day, but no news from Amiens. I know not what to conjecture. My
patience is almo&#383;t exhau&#383;ted, and my &#383;pirits are
fatigued. Were I not ju&#383;t now relieved by a di&#383;tant
pro&#383;pect of &#383;ome change for the better, my &#383;ituation
would be in&#383;upportable.&mdash;"Oh world! oh world! but that
thy &#383;trange mutations make us wait thee, life would not yield
to age." We &#383;hould die before our time, even of moral
di&#383;ea&#383;es, unaided by phy&#383;ical ones; but the
uncertainty of human events, which is the "worm i'the bud" of
happine&#383;s, is to the mi&#383;erable a cheering and
con&#383;olatory reflection. Thus have I dragged on for &#383;ome
weeks, po&#383;tponing, as it were, my exi&#383;tence, without any
re&#383;ource, &#383;ave the homely philo&#383;ophy of <i>"nous
verrons demain."</i> ["We &#383;hall &#383;ee to-morrow."]</p>
<p>At length our hopes and expectations are become le&#383;s
general, and if we do not obtain our liberty, we may be able at
lea&#383;t to procure a more eligible pri&#383;on. I confe&#383;s,
the &#383;ource of our hopes, and the protector we have found, are
not of a dignity to be u&#383;hered to your notice by citations of
blank ver&#383;e, or &#383;craps of &#383;entiment; for though the
top of the ladder is not quite &#383;o high, the fir&#383;t rounds
are as low as that of Ben Bowling's.</p>
<p>Mad. de ____'s confidential &#383;ervant, who came here to-day,
has learned, by accident, that a man, who formerly worked with the
Marqui&#383;'s tailor, having (in con&#383;equence, I
&#383;uppo&#383;e of a political vocation,) quitted the
&#383;elling of old clothes, in which he had acquired &#383;ome
eminence, ha&#383; become a leading patriot, and is one of Le
Bon's, the Repre&#383;entative's, privy coun&#383;ellors. Fleury
has renewed his acquaintance with this man, has con&#383;ulted him
upon our &#383;ituation, and obtained a promi&#383;e that he will
u&#383;e his intere&#383;t with Le Bon in our behalf. Under this
&#383;plendid patronage, it is not unlikely but we may get an order
to be tran&#383;ferred to Amiens, or, perhaps, procure our entire
liberation. We have already written to Le Bon on the &#383;ubject,
and Fleury is to have a conference with our friend the tailor in a
few days to learn the &#383;ucce&#383;s of hi&#383; mediation;
&#383;o that, I tru&#383;t, the bu&#383;ine&#383;s will not be long
in &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e.</p>
<p>We have had a mo&#383;t indulgent guard to-day, who, by
&#383;uffering the &#383;ervant to enter a few paces within the
gate, afforded us an opportunity of hearing this agreeable
intelligence; as al&#383;o, by way of epi&#383;ode, that boots
being wanted for the cavalry, all the boots in the town were
la&#383;t night put in requi&#383;ition, and as Fleury was
unluckily gone to bed before the &#383;earch was made at his inn,
he found him&#383;elf this morning very unceremoniou&#383;ly left
bootle&#383;s. He was once a famous patriot, and the oracle of Mad.
de ____'s hou&#383;ehold; but our confinement had already
&#383;haken his principles, and this &#383;eizure of his
"&#383;uperb Engli&#383;h boot&#383;" has, I believe, completed his
defection.</p>

<h2>Oct. 25.</h2>
<p>I have di&#383;continued my journal for three days to attend my
friend, Mad. de ____, who has been ill. Unea&#383;ine&#383;s, and
want of air and exerci&#383;e, had brought on a little fever,
which, by the u&#383;ual mode of treatment in thi&#383; country,
has been con&#383;iderably increa&#383;ed. Her di&#383;order did
not indeed much alarm me, but I cannot &#383;ay as much of her
medical a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tants, and it &#383;eems to me to be
almo&#383;t &#383;upernatural that &#383;he has e&#383;caped the
jeopardy of their pre&#383;criptions. In my own illne&#383;s I had
tru&#383;ted to nature, and my recollection of what had been
ordered me on &#383;imilar occa&#383;ions; but for Mad. de ____ I
was le&#383;s confident, and de&#383;irous of having better advice,
begged a phy&#383;ician might be immediately &#383;ent for. Had her
di&#383;order been an apoplexy, &#383;he mu&#383;t infallibly have
died, for as no per&#383;on, not even the faculty, can enter,
without an order from the municipal Divan, half a day elap&#383;ed
before this order could be procured. At length the phy&#383;ician
and &#383;urgeon arrived, and I know not why the learned
profe&#383;&#383;ions &#383;hould impo&#383;e on us more by one
exterior than another; but I own, when I &#383;aw the
phy&#383;ician appear in a white camblet coat, lined with ro&#383;e
colour, and the &#383;urgeon with dirty linen, and a gold button
and loop to his hat, I began to tremble for my friend. My feminine
prejudices did not, however, in this in&#383;tance, deceive me.
After the u&#383;ual que&#383;tions, the patient wa&#383; declared
in a fever, and condemned to cathartics, bleeding, and "bon
bouillons;" that is to &#383;ay, grea&#383;y beef &#383;oup, in
which there is never an oeconomy of onions.&mdash;When they were
departed, I could not help expre&#383;&#383;ing my &#383;urprize
that people's lives &#383;hould be entru&#383;ted to &#383;uch
hands, ob&#383;erving, at the &#383;ame time, to the Baron de
L____, (who is lodged in the &#383;ame apartment with Mad. de
____,) that the French mu&#383;t never expect men, who&#383;e
education fitted them for the profe&#383;&#383;ion, would become
phy&#383;icians, while they continued to be paid at the rate of
twenty-pence per vi&#383;it.&mdash; Yet, replied the Baron, if they
make twenty vi&#383;its a day, they gain forty
livre&#383;&mdash;<i>"et c'e&#383;t de quoi vivre."</i> [It is a
living.] It is undeniably <i>de quoi vivre,</i> but as long as a
mere &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence is the only pro&#383;pect of a
phy&#383;ician, the French mu&#383;t be content to have their
fevers cured by "dra&#383;tics, phlebotomy, and beef
&#383;oup."</p>
<p>They tell me we have now more than five hundred detenus in this
&#383;ingle hou&#383;e. How &#383;o many have been wedged in I can
&#383;carcely conceive, but it &#383;eems our keeper has the art of
calculating with great nicety the &#383;pace requi&#383;ite for a
given number of bodies, and their being able to re&#383;pire freely
is not his affair. Tho&#383;e who can afford it have their dinners,
with all the appurtenances, brought from the inns or traiteurs; and
the poor cook, &#383;leep, and eat, by &#383;cores, in the
&#383;ame room. I have per&#383;uaded my friend to &#383;up as I
do, upon tea; but our a&#383;&#383;ociates, for the mo&#383;t part,
finding it inconvenient to have &#383;uppers brought at night, and
being unwilling to &#383;ubmit to the &#383;ame privations, regale
them&#383;elves with the remains of their dinner, re-cooked in
their apartments, and thus go to &#383;leep, amid&#383;t the fumes
of <i>perdrix a l'onion, oeufs a la tripe,</i> [Partridge a
l'onion&mdash;eggs a la tripe.] and all the produce of a French
kitchen.</p>
<p>It is not, as you may imagine, the Bourgeois, and le&#383;s
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed pri&#383;oners only, who indulge in
the&#383;e highly-&#383;ea&#383;oned repa&#383;ts, at the expence
of inhaling the &#383;avoury atmo&#383;phere they leave behind
them: the beaux and petites mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es, among the
ci-devant, have not le&#383;s exigent appetites, nor more delicate
nerves; and the ragout is produced at night, in &#383;pite of the
odours and di&#383;order that remain till the morrow.</p>
<p>I conclude, notwith&#383;tanding your Engli&#383;h prejudices,
that there i&#383; nothing unwhole&#383;ome in filth, for if it
were otherwi&#383;e, I cannot account for our being alive. Five
hundred bodies, in a &#383;tate of coacervation, without even a
preference for cleanline&#383;s, "think of that Ma&#383;ter Brook."
All the forenoon the court is a receptacle for cabbage leaves,
fi&#383;h &#383;cales, leeks, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and as a French
chambermaid u&#383;ually prefers the direct road to
circumambulation, the refu&#383;e of the kitchen is then
wa&#383;hed away by plentiful inundations from the
dre&#383;&#383;ing-room&mdash;the pa&#383;&#383;ages are blockaded
by foul plates, fragments, and bones; to which if you add the
&#383;mell exhaling from hoarded apples and gruyere chee&#383;e,
you may form &#383;ome notion of the &#383;ufferings of tho&#383;e
who&#383;e olfactory nerves are not robu&#383;t. Yet this is not
all&mdash;nearly every female in the hou&#383;e, except
my&#383;elf, i&#383; accompanied even here by her lap-dog, who
&#383;leeps in her room, and, not unfrequently, on her bed; and
the&#383;e Le&#383;bias and Lindamiras increa&#383;e the
in&#383;alubrity of the air, and colonize one's &#383;tockings by
&#383;ending forth daily emigrations of fleas. For my own part, a
few clo&#383;e November day&#383; will make me as captious and
&#383;plenetic as Matthew Bramble him&#383;elf. Nothing keeps me in
tolerable good humour at pre&#383;ent, but a clear fro&#383;ty
morning, or a high wind.</p>

<h2>Oct. 27.</h2>
<p>I thought, when I wrote the above, that the hou&#383;e was
really &#383;o full a&#383; to be incapable of containing more; but
I did not do ju&#383;tice to the talents of our keeper. The
la&#383;t two nights have brought us an addition of &#383;everal
waggon loads of nuns, farmers, &#383;hopkeepers, &amp;c. from the
neighbouring towns, which he has &#383;till contrived to lodge,
though much in the way that he would pack goods in bales. Should
another convoy arrive, it is certain that we mu&#383;t &#383;leep
perpendicularly, for even now, when the beds are all arranged and
occupied for the night, no one can make a diagonal movement without
di&#383;turbing his neighbour.&mdash;This very &#383;ociable manner
of &#383;leeping is very far, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, from
promoting the harmony of the day; and I am frequently witne&#383;s
to the reproaches and recriminations occa&#383;ioned by nocturnal
mi&#383;demeanours. Sometimes the lap-dog of one dowager is
accu&#383;ed of ho&#383;tilities again&#383;t that of another, and
thereby producing a general chorus of the re&#383;t&mdash;then a
four-footed favourite &#383;trays from the bed of his
mi&#383;tre&#383;s, and take&#383; po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion
of a General's uniform&mdash;and there are female &#383;omnambules,
who alarm the mode&#383;ty of a pair of Bi&#383;hops, and
&#383;u&#383;pended officers, that, like Richard, warring in their
dreams, cry "to arms," to the great annoyance of tho&#383;e who are
more inclined to &#383;leep in peace. But, I under&#383;tand, the
great di&#383;turbers of the room where Mad. de ____
&#383;leep&#383; are two chanoines, who&#383;e no&#383;es are
&#383;o &#383;onorous and &#383;o untuneable as to produce a
&#383;ort of duet ab&#383;olutely incompatible with &#383;leep; and
one of the company is often deputed to interrupt the &#383;erenade
by manual application <i>mais tout en badinant et avec
polite&#383;&#383;e</i> [But all in plea&#383;antry, and with
politene&#383;s.] to the offending parties.</p>
<p>All this, my dear brother, is only ludicrous in the relation;
yet for &#383;o many people to be thus huddled together without
di&#383;tinction of age, &#383;ex, or condition, is truly
mi&#383;erable.&mdash;Mad. De ____ is &#383;till
indi&#383;po&#383;ed, and while &#383;he is thus &#383;uffocated by
bad air, and di&#383;tracted by the variou&#383; noi&#383;es of the
hou&#383;e, I &#383;ee no pro&#383;pect of her recovery.</p>
<p>Arras is the common pri&#383;on of the department, and,
be&#383;ides, there are a number of other hou&#383;es and convents
in the town appropriated to the &#383;ame u&#383;e, and all equally
full. God knows when the&#383;e iniquities are to terminate! So far
from having any hopes at pre&#383;ent, the rage for arre&#383;ting
&#383;eems, I think, rather to increa&#383;e than
&#383;ub&#383;ide. It i&#383; &#383;uppo&#383;ed there are now more
than three hundred thou&#383;and people in France confined under
the &#383;imple imputation of being what is called "gen&#383;
&#383;u&#383;pect:" but as this generic term is new to you, I will,
by way of explanation, particularize the &#383;everal &#383;pecies
as cla&#383;&#383;ed by the Convention, and then de&#383;cribed by
Chaumette, &#383;olicitor for the City of Paris;*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Decree concerning &#383;u&#383;pected people: "Art.
I. Immediately after the promulgation of the pre&#383;ent decree,
all &#383;u&#383;pected per&#383;ons that are found on the
territory of the republic, and who are &#383;till at large,
&#383;hall be put under arre&#383;t. "II. Tho&#383;e are deemed
&#383;u&#383;picious, who by their connections, their
conver&#383;ation, or their writings, declare them&#383;elves
partizans of tyranny or foederation, and enemies to
liberty&mdash;Tho&#383;e who have not demon&#383;trated their means
of living or the performance of their civic duties, in the manner
pre&#383;cribed by the law of March la&#383;t&mdash;Tho&#383;e who,
having been &#383;u&#383;pended from public employments by the
Convention or its Commi&#383;&#383;ioners, are not rein&#383;tated
therein&mdash;Tho&#383;e of the ci-devant noble&#383;&#383;e, who
have not invariably manife&#383;ted their attachment to the
revolution, and, in general, all the fathers, mothers, &#383;ons,
daughters, brothers, &#383;i&#383;ters, and agents of
emigrant&#383;&mdash;All who have emigrated between the 1&#383;t of
July, 1789, and 8th of April, 1792. "III. The execution of the
decree is confided to the Committee of In&#383;pection. The
individuals arre&#383;ted &#383;hall be taken to the
hou&#383;e&#383; of confinement appointed for their reception. They
are allowed to take with them &#383;uch only of their effects as
are &#383;trictly nece&#383;&#383;ary, the guards &#383;et upon
them &#383;hall be paid at their expence, and they &#383;hall be
kept in confinement until the peace.&mdash;The Committees of
In&#383;pection &#383;hall, without delay, tran&#383;mit to the
Committee of General Safety an account of the per&#383;ons
arre&#383;ted, with the motive&#383; of their arre&#383;t. [If this
were ob&#383;erved (which I doubt much) it wa&#383; but a mockery,
few per&#383;ons ever knew the preci&#383;e rea&#383;on of their
confinement.]&mdash;The civil and criminal tribunals are empowered,
when they deem it nece&#383;&#383;ary, to detain and impri&#383;on,
as &#383;u&#383;pected per&#383;ons, tho&#383;e who being
accu&#383;ed of crimes have neverthele&#383;s had no bill found
again&#383;t them, (lieu a accu&#383;ation,) or who have even been
tried and acquitted."</blockquote>

<p>Indications that may &#383;erve to di&#383;tingui&#383;h
&#383;u&#383;picious per&#383;ons, and tho&#383;e to whom it will
be proper to refu&#383;e certificates of civi&#383;m:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>"I. Tho&#383;e who in popular a&#383;&#383;emblies
check the ardour of the people by artful &#383;peeches, by violent
exclamations or threats. "II. Tho&#383;e who with more caution
&#383;peak in a my&#383;terious way of the public mi&#383;fortunes,
who appear to pity the lot of the people, and are ever ready to
&#383;pread bad news with an affectation of concern. "III.
Tho&#383;e who adapt their conduct and language to the
circum&#383;tances of the moment&mdash;who, in order to be taken
for republicans, put on a &#383;tudied au&#383;terity of manners,
and exclaim with vehemence again&#383;t the mo&#383;t trifling
error in a patriot, but mollify when the crimes of an
Ari&#383;tocrate or a Moderee are the &#383;ubject of complaint.
[The&#383;e trifling events were, being concerned in the
ma&#383;&#383;acres of September, 1792&mdash;public
peculation&#383;&mdash;occa&#383;ional, and even habitual robbery,
forgeries, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;The &#383;econd, fourth,
fifth, &#383;ixth, and &#383;eventh cla&#383;&#383;es, were
particularly numerous, in&#383;omuch that I doubt whether they
would not have included nineteen-twentieths of all the people in
France who were hone&#383;t or at all capable of reflection.] "IV.
Tho&#383;e who pity avaricious farmers and &#383;hopkeepers,
again&#383;t whom the laws have been nece&#383;&#383;arily
directed. "V. Tho&#383;e who with the words liberty, country,
republic, &amp;c. con&#383;tantly in their mouths, hold
intercour&#383;e with ci-devant Nobles, Contre-revolutionnaires,
Prie&#383;ts, Ari&#383;tocrates, Feuillans, &amp;c. and take an
intere&#383;t in their concerns. "VI. Tho&#383;e who not having
borne an active part in the revolution, endeavour to excu&#383;e
them&#383;elves by urging the regular payment of their taxes, their
patriotic gifts, and their &#383;ervice in the Garde National by
&#383;ub&#383;titute or otherwi&#383;e. "VII. Tho&#383;e who
received the republican con&#383;titution with coolne&#383;s, or
who intimated their pretended apprehen&#383;ions for its
e&#383;tabli&#383;hment and duration. "VIII. Tho&#383;e who, having
done nothing again&#383;t liberty, have done a&#383; little for it.
"IX. Tho&#383;e who do not frequent the a&#383;&#383;embly of their
&#383;ection, and offer, for excu&#383;e, that they are no orators,
or have no time to &#383;pare from their own bu&#383;ine&#383;s.
"X. Tho&#383;e who &#383;peak with contempt of the con&#383;tituted
authorities, of the rigour of the laws, of the popular
&#383;ocieties, and the defenders of liberty. "XI. Tho&#383;e who
have &#383;igned anti-revolutionary petitions, or any time
frequented unpatriotic clubs, or were known as partizans of La
Fayette, and accomplices in the affair of the Champ de
Mars."</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;and it mu&#383;t be allowed by all who re&#383;ide in
France at this moment, and are capable of ob&#383;erving the
various forms under which hatred for the government &#383;helters
it&#383;elf, that the latter is a chef d'oeuvre in it&#383;
kind.</p>
<p>Now, exclu&#383;ive of the above legal and moral indications of
people to be &#383;u&#383;pected, there are al&#383;o outward and
vi&#383;ible &#383;igns which we are told from the tribune of the
Convention, and the Jacobins, are not much le&#383;&#383;
infallible&mdash;&#383;uch as <i>Gens a bas de &#383;oie rayes
mouchete&#383;&mdash;a chapeau rond&mdash; habit
carre&mdash;culotte pincee etroite&mdash;a bottes
ciree&#383;&mdash;les mu&#383;cadin&#383;&mdash;
Freloquet&#383;&mdash;Robinets, &amp;c.</i> [People that wear
&#383;potted or &#383;triped &#383;ilk
&#383;tocking&#383;&mdash;round hat&#383;&mdash;&#383;mall
coat&#383;&mdash;tight breeche&#383;&mdash;blacked
boot&#383;&mdash;
perfume&#383;&mdash;coxcomb&#383;&mdash;&#383;prigs of the law,
&amp;c.] The con&#383;equence of making the cut of a man's coat, or
the &#383;hape of his hat, a te&#383;t of his political opinions,
has been the tran&#383;formation of the whole country into
republicans, at lea&#383;t as far as depends on the co&#383;tume;
and where, as i&#383; natural, there exi&#383;ts a
con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of inveterate ari&#383;tocracy, the
external is more elaborately "a la Jacobin." The equipment, indeed,
of a French patriot of the late&#383;t date is as &#383;ingular as
his manners, and in both he is highly di&#383;tingui&#383;hable
from the inhabitants of any other country: from tho&#383;e of
civilized nations, becau&#383;e he is gro&#383;s and
ferociou&#383;&mdash;from tho&#383;e of barbarous ones,
becau&#383;e his gro&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s is often affected, and
his ferocity a matter of principle and preference.</p>
<p>A man who would not be reckoned &#383;u&#383;pect now arrays
him&#383;elf in a jacket and trow&#383;ers (a Carmagnole) of
&#383;triped cotton or coar&#383;e cloth, a neckcloth of gaudy
cotton, wadded like a hor&#383;e-collar, and projecting
con&#383;iderably beyond his chin, a cap of red and blue cloth,
embroidered in front and made much in the form of that worn by the
Pierrot of a pantomime, with one, or &#383;ometimes a pair, of
ear-rings, about the &#383;ize of a large curtain-ring! Finally, he
crops his hair, and carefully encourages the growth of an enormous
pair of whi&#383;kers, which he does not fail to perfume with
volumes of tobacco &#383;moke. He, however, who i&#383; ambitious
of &#383;till greater eminence, di&#383;dains the&#383;e fopperies,
and affects an appearance of filth and rags, which he dignifies
with the appellation of &#383;tern republicani&#383;m and virtuous
poverty; and thus, by means of a thread-bare coat out at elbows,
wooden &#383;hoes, and a red woollen cap, the rich hope to
&#383;ecure their wealth, and the covetous and intriguing to
acquire lucrative employment.&mdash;Rolland, I think, was the
founder of the&#383;e modern Franci&#383;cans, and with this
mi&#383;erable affectation he machinated the death of the King,
and, during &#383;ome months, procured for him&#383;elf the
exclu&#383;ive direction of the government.</p>
<p>All the&#383;e patriots by pre&#383;cription and
&#383;y&#383;tem have likewi&#383;e a peculiar and appropriated
dialect&mdash;they addre&#383;s every one by the title of Citizen,
thee and thou indi&#383;tinctly, and talk of nothing but the agents
of Pitt and Cobourg, the coale&#383;ced tyrants, royal ogres,
&#383;atellites of the de&#383;pots, automaton &#383;laves, and
anthropophagi; and if they revert to their own pro&#383;perous
&#383;tate, and this very happy country, it is, <i>un peuple libre,
en peuple heureux, and par excellence la terre de la liberte.</i>
["A free people&mdash;a happy people&mdash;and, above all others,
the land of liberty."]&mdash;It is to be ob&#383;erved, that
tho&#383;e with whom the&#383;e pompou&#383; expre&#383;&#383;ions
are mo&#383;t familiar, are officers employed in the war-like
&#383;ervice of mutilating the wooden &#383;aints in churches, and
arre&#383;ting old women whom they encounter without national
cockades; or members of the municipalities, now reduced to execute
the offices of con&#383;tables, and who&#383;e chief functions are
to hunt out &#383;u&#383;pected people, or make domiciliary
vi&#383;its in que&#383;t of concealed eggs and butter. But, above
all, this democratic oratory is u&#383;ed by tailors,
&#383;hoemakers, &amp;c.* of the Committees of In&#383;pection, to
whom the Repre&#383;entatives on mi&#383;&#383;ion have delegated
their unlimited powers, who arre&#383;t much on the principle of
Jack Cade, and with whom it is a crime to read and write, or to
appear decently dre&#383;&#383;ed.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* For &#383;ome months the departments were
infe&#383;ted by people of thi&#383;
de&#383;cription&mdash;corrupt, ignorant, and in&#383;olent. Their
motives of arre&#383;t were u&#383;ually the hope of plunder, or
the de&#383;ire of di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ing tho&#383;e whom they
had been u&#383;ed to look upon as their &#383;uperiors.&mdash;At
Arras it &#383;ufficed even to have di&#383;obliged the wive&#383;
of the&#383;e mi&#383;creants to become the object of
per&#383;ecution. In &#383;ome places they arre&#383;ted with the
mo&#383;t barbarous caprice, even without the &#383;hadow of a
rea&#383;on. At He&#383;den, a &#383;mall town in Artois, Dumont
left the Mayor carte blanche, and in one night two hundred people
were thrown into pri&#383;on. Every where the&#383;e low and
ob&#383;cure dominators reigned without controul, and &#383;o much
were the people intimidated, that in&#383;tead of daring to
complain, they treated their new tyrants with the mo&#383;t
&#383;ervile adulation.&mdash;I have &#383;een a ci-devant
Comte&#383;&#383;e coquetting with all her might a Jacobin tailor,
and the riche&#383;t merchants of a town &#383;oliciting very
humbly the good offices of a dealer in old clothes.</blockquote>

<p>The&#383;e ridiculous accoutrements, and this magnificent

the a&#383;cendancy which &#383;uch a cla&#383;s of people are
taking has become a &#383;ubject of ju&#383;t alarm.&mdash;The
whole admini&#383;tration of the country is now in the hands of
uninformed and nece&#383;&#383;itou&#383; profligates,
&#383;windlers, men already condemned by the laws, and who, if the
revolution had not given them "place and office," would have been
at the galleys, or in pri&#383;on.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* One of the admini&#383;trators of the department de
la Somme (which, however, was more decently compo&#383;ed than many
others,) was, before the revolution, convicted of
hou&#383;e-breaking, and another of forgery; and it has &#383;ince
been proved on various occa&#383;ions, particularly on the trial of
the ninety-four Nantais, that the revolutionary Committees were,
for the mo&#383;t part, compo&#383;ed of the very refu&#383;e of
&#383;ociety&mdash;adventurers, thieves, and even
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins; and it would be difficult to imagine
a crime that did not there find reward and protection.&mdash;In
vain were the privileges of the nobility aboli&#383;hed, and
religion pro&#383;cribed. A new privileged order aro&#383;e in the
Jacobins, and guilt of every kind, without the &#383;emblance of
penitence, found an a&#383;ylum in the&#383;e Committees, and an
inviolability more &#383;acred than that afforded by the
demoli&#383;hed altars.</blockquote>

<p>To the&#383;e may be added a few men of weak character, and

harra&#383;s and confine the per&#383;ons and &#383;eque&#383;ter
the property of all whom they judged proper.&mdash;It &#383;eemed
to have been an elementary principle with tho&#383;e employed by
the government at this time, that they ri&#383;ked nothing in doing
all the mi&#383;chief they could, and that they erred only in not
doing enough.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;All, therefore, that can be obtained is, a promi&#383;e
to have us removed to Amiens in a &#383;hort time; and I
under&#383;tand the detenus are there treated with
con&#383;ideration, and that no tribunal revolutionnaire has yet
been e&#383;tabli&#383;hed.</p>
<p>My mind will be con&#383;iderably more at ea&#383;e if this
removal can be effected. Perhaps we may not be in more real danger
here than at any other place, but it is not realities that
con&#383;titute the mi&#383;ery of life; and &#383;ituated as we
are, that imagination mu&#383;t be phlegmatic indeed, which does
not create and exaggerate enough to prevent the
po&#383;&#383;ibility of ea&#383;e.&mdash;We are, as I before
ob&#383;erved, placed as it were within the juri&#383;diction of
the guillotine; and I have learned "a &#383;ecret of our
pri&#383;on-hou&#383;e" to-day which Mad. de ____ had hitherto
concealed from me, and which has rendered me &#383;till more
anxious to quit it. Several of our fellow pri&#383;oners, whom I
&#383;uppo&#383;ed only tran&#383;ferred to other hou&#383;es, have
been taken away to undergo the ceremony of a trial, and from thence
to the &#383;caffold. The&#383;e judicial ma&#383;&#383;acres are
now become common, and the repetition of them has de&#383;troyed at
once the feeling of humanity and the &#383;en&#383;e of
ju&#383;tice. Familiarized to executions, the thoughtle&#383;s and
&#383;anguinary people behold with equal indifference the guilty or
innocent victim; and the Guillotine has not only cea&#383;ed to be
an object of horror, but is become almo&#383;t a &#383;ource of
amu&#383;ement.</p>

<blockquote>* At Arras this horrid in&#383;trument of death was
what they called en permanence, (&#383;tationary,) and &#383;o
little regard was paid to the morals of the people, (I &#383;ay the
morals, becau&#383;e every thing which tends to de&#383;troy their
humanity renders them vicious,) that it wa&#383; often left from
one execution to another with the en&#383;anguined trace&#383; of
the la&#383;t victim but too evident.&mdash;Children were taught to
amu&#383;e them&#383;elves by making models of the Guillotine, with
which they de&#383;troyed flies, and even animals. On the Pontneuf,
at Paris, a &#383;ort of puppet-&#383;how was exhibited daily,
who&#383;e boa&#383;t it was to give a very exact imitation of a
guillotinage; and the burthen of a popular &#383;ong current for
&#383;ome months was <i>"Dan&#383;ons la Guillotine."</i> &mdash;On
the 21&#383;t of January, 1794, the anniver&#383;ary of the King's
death, the Convention were invited to celebrate it on the "Place de
la Revolution," where, during the ceremony, and in pre&#383;ence of
the whole legi&#383;lative body, &#383;everal people were executed.
It is true, Bourdon, one of the Deputies, complained of this
indecency; but not &#383;o much on account of the circum&#383;tance
it&#383;elf, as becau&#383;e it gave &#383;ome of the people an
opportunity of telling him, in a &#383;ort of way he might probably
deem prophetic, that one of the victims was a Repre&#383;entative
of the People. The Convention pretended to order that &#383;ome
enquiry &#383;hould be made why at &#383;uch a moment &#383;uch a
place was cho&#383;en; but the enquiry came to nothing, and I have
no doubt but the executions were purpo&#383;ely intended as
analogous to the ceremony.&mdash;It was proved that Le Bon, on an
occa&#383;ion when he cho&#383;e to be a &#383;pectator of
&#383;ome executions he had been the cau&#383;e of,
&#383;u&#383;pended the operation while he read the new&#383;paper
aloud, in order, as he &#383;aid, that the ari&#383;tocrates might
go out of the world with the additional mortification of learning
the &#383;ucce&#383;s of the republican arms in their la&#383;t
moments. The People of Bre&#383;t were &#383;uffered to behold, I
had almo&#383;t &#383;aid to be amu&#383;ed with (for if tho&#383;e
who order &#383;uch &#383;pectacles are dete&#383;table, the people
that permit them are not free from blame,) the &#383;ight of
twenty-five heads ranged in a line, and &#383;till convul&#383;ed
with the agonies of death.&mdash;The cant word for the Guillotine
was "our holy mother;" and verdicts of condemnation were called
prizes in the Sainte Lotterie&mdash;"holy lottery."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The dark and ferocious character of Le Bon developes it&#383;elf
hourly: the whole department trembles before him; and tho&#383;e
who have lea&#383;t merited per&#383;ecution are, with rea&#383;on,
the mo&#383;t apprehen&#383;ive. The mo&#383;t cautiou&#383;
prudence of conduct, the mo&#383;t undeviating rectitude in
tho&#383;e who are by their fortune or rank obnoxious to the
tyrant, far from contributing to their &#383;ecurity, only mark
them out for a more early &#383;acrifice. What i&#383; &#383;till
wor&#383;e, the&#383;e horrors are not likely to terminate,
becau&#383;e he i&#383; allowed to pay out of the trea&#383;ury of
the department the mob that are employed to popularize and applaud
them.&mdash;I hope, in a few days, we &#383;hall receive our
permi&#383;&#383;ion to depart. My impatience is a malady, and, for
nearly the fir&#383;t time in my life, I am &#383;en&#383;ible of
ennui; not the ennui occa&#383;ioned by want of amu&#383;ement, but
that which is the effect of unquiet expectation, and which makes
both the mind and body re&#383;tle&#383;s and incapable of
attending to any thing. I am ince&#383;&#383;antly haunted by the
idea that the companion of to-day may to-morrow expire under the
Guillotine, that the common acts of &#383;ocial intercour&#383;e
may be explained into intimacy, intimacy into the participation of
imputed trea&#383;ons, and the fate of tho&#383;e with whom we are
a&#383;&#383;ociated become our own. It appear&#383; both
u&#383;ele&#383;s and cruel to have brought us here, nor do I yet
know any rea&#383;on why we were not all removed to Amiens, except
it was to avoid expo&#383;ing to the eyes of the people in the
places through which we mu&#383;t pa&#383;s too large a number of
victims at once.&mdash;The cau&#383;e of our being removed from
Peronne is indeed avowed, as it is at pre&#383;ent a rule not to
confine people at the place of their re&#383;idence, le&#383;t they
&#383;hould have too much facility or communication with, or
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance from, their friends.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* In &#383;ome departments the nobles and prie&#383;ts
arre&#383;ted were removed from ten to twenty leagues di&#383;tant
from their homes; and if they happened to have relations living at
the places where they were confined, the&#383;e la&#383;t were
forbidden to re&#383;ide there, or even to travel that
way.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We &#383;hould doubtle&#383;s have remained at Arras until
&#383;ome change in public affairs had procured our relea&#383;e,
but for the fortunate di&#383;covery of the man I have mentioned;
and the trifling favour of removal from one pri&#383;on to another
has been obtained only by certain arrangements which Fleury has
made with this &#383;ubordinate agent of tyranny, and in which
ju&#383;tice or con&#383;ideration for us had no &#383;hare.
Ala&#383;! are we not mi&#383;erable? is not the country
mi&#383;erable, when our only re&#383;ource is in the vices of
tho&#383;e who govern?&mdash;It is uncertain when we &#383;hall be
ordered from hence&mdash;it may happen when we lea&#383;t expect
it, even in the night, &#383;o that I &#383;hall not attempt to
write again till we have changed our &#383;ituation. The ri&#383;k
i&#383; at pre&#383;ent too &#383;erious, and you mu&#383;t allow
my de&#383;ire of amu&#383;ing you to give way to my

<h2>Bicetre at Amiens, Nov. 18, 1793.</h2>
<p><i>Nous voila donc encore, logees a la nation;</i> that is to
&#383;ay, the common pri&#383;on of the department, amid&#383;t the
thieves, vagabonds, maniacs, &amp;c. confined by the old police,
and the gens &#383;u&#383;pects recently arre&#383;ted by the
new.&mdash;I write from the end of a &#383;ort of elevated barn,
&#383;ixty or &#383;eventy feet long, where the inter&#383;tices of
the tiles admit the wind from all quarters, and &#383;carcely
exclude the rain, and where an old &#383;creen and &#383;ome
curtains only &#383;eparate Mad. de ____, my&#383;elf, and our
&#383;ervants, from &#383;ixty prie&#383;ts, mo&#383;t of them old,
&#383;ick, and as wretched as men can be, who are pious and
re&#383;igned. Yet even here I feel comparatively at ea&#383;e, and
an e&#383;cape from the juri&#383;diction of Le Bon and his
mercile&#383;s tribunal &#383;eems cheaply purcha&#383;ed by the
&#383;acrifice of our per&#383;onal convenience. I do not pretend
to philo&#383;ophize or &#383;toicize, or to any thing el&#383;e
which implies a contempt of life&mdash;I have, on the contrary, a
mo&#383;t unheroic &#383;olicitude about my exi&#383;tence, and
con&#383;ider my removal to a place where I think we are &#383;afe,
as a very fortunate aera of our captivity.</p>
<p>After many delays and di&#383;appointments, Fleury at length
procured an order, &#383;igned by the Repre&#383;entative, for our
being tran&#383;ferred to Amiens, under the care of two <i>Gardes
Nationalaux,</i> and, of cour&#383;e, at our expence.&mdash;Every
thing in this country wears the a&#383;pect of de&#383;poti&#383;m.
At twelve o'clock at night we were awakened by the officer on
guard, and informed we were to depart on the morrow; and,
notwith&#383;tanding the difficulty of procuring hor&#383;es and
carriages, it was &#383;pecified, that if we did not go on the day
appointed, we were not to go at all. It was, or cour&#383;e, late
before we could &#383;urmount the various ob&#383;tacles to our
journey, and procure two crazy cabriolets, and a cart for the
guards, our&#383;elves, and baggage. The days being &#383;hort, we
were obliged to &#383;leep at Dourlens; and, on our arrival at the
ca&#383;tle, which is now, as it always has been, a
&#383;tate-pri&#383;on, we were told it was &#383;o full, that it
wa&#383; ab&#383;olutely impo&#383;&#383;ible to lodge us, and that
we had better apply to the Governor, for permi&#383;&#383;ion to
&#383;leep at an inn. We then drove to the Governor'&#383;*
hou&#383;e, who received us very civilly, and with very little
per&#383;ua&#383;ion agreed to our reque&#383;t. At the be&#383;t
of the mi&#383;erable inns in the town we were informed they had no
room, and that they could not accommodate us in any way whatever,
except a &#383;ick officer then in the hou&#383;e would permit us
to occupy one of two beds in his apartment.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The Commandant had been originally a private
&#383;oldier in the regiment of Dillon.&mdash;I know not how he had
obtained his advancement, but, however obtained, it proved fatal to
him: he was, a very &#383;hort time after I &#383;aw him,
guillotined at Arras, for having borrowed money of a pri&#383;oner.
His real crime was, probably, treating the pri&#383;oners in
general with too much con&#383;ideration and indulgence; and at
this period every &#383;u&#383;picion of the kind was
fatal.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In England it would not be very decent to make &#383;uch a
reque&#383;t, or to accept &#383;uch an accommodation. In France,
neither the one nor the other is unu&#383;ual, and we had
&#383;uffered lately &#383;o many embarra&#383;&#383;ments of the
kind, that we were, if not reconciled, at lea&#383;t inured to
them. Before, however, we could determine, the gentleman had been
informed of our &#383;ituation, and came to offer his
&#383;ervices. You may judge of our &#383;urprize when we found in
the &#383;tranger, who had his head bound up and his arm in a
&#383;ling, General ____, a relation of Mad. de ____. We had now,
therefore, le&#383;s &#383;cruple in &#383;haring his room, though
we agreed, notwith&#383;tanding, only to repo&#383;e a few hours in
our clothes.</p>
<p>After taking &#383;ome tea, the remainder of the evening was
dedicated to reciprocal conver&#383;ation of all kinds; and our
guards having acquaintance in the town, and knowing it was
impo&#383;&#383;ible for us to e&#383;cape, even were we &#383;o
inclined, very civilly left us to our&#383;elves. We found the
General had been wounded at Maubeuge, and was now ab&#383;ent on
conge for the recovery of his health. He talked of the pre&#383;ent
&#383;tate of public affairs like a military man who is attached to
his profe&#383;&#383;ion, and who thinks it hi&#383; duty to fight
at all events, whatever the rights or merits of tho&#383;e that
employ him. He confe&#383;&#383;ed, indeed, that they were
repul&#383;ing their external enemies, only to confirm the power of
tho&#383;e who were infinitely more to be dreaded at home, and that
the condition of a General was more to be commi&#383;erated at this
time than any other: if he mi&#383;carry, di&#383;grace and the
Guillotine await him&mdash;if he be &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful, he
gains little honour, becomes an object of jealou&#383;y, and
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ts in rivetting the chains of his country. He
&#383;aid, the armies were for the mo&#383;t part licentious and
in&#383;ubordinate, but that the political di&#383;cipline wa&#383;
terrible&mdash;the &#383;oldiers are allowed to drink, pillage, and
in&#383;ult their officers with impunity, but all combinations are
rigorou&#383;ly &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed, the &#383;lighte&#383;t
murmur again&#383;t the Repre&#383;entative on mi&#383;&#383;ion is
trea&#383;on, and to di&#383;approve of a decree of the convention,
death&mdash;that every man of any note in the army is be&#383;et
with &#383;pies, and if they leave the camp on any occa&#383;ion,
it is more nece&#383;&#383;ary to be on their guard again&#383;t
the&#383;e wretches than again&#383;t an ambu&#383;cade of the
enemy; and he related a circum&#383;tance which happened to
him&#383;elf, as an example of what he mentioned, and which will
give you a tolerable idea of the pre&#383;ent &#383;y&#383;tem of
government.&mdash;After the relief of Dunkirk, being quartered in
the neighbourhood of St. Omer, he occa&#383;ionally went to the
town on hi&#383; private concerns. One day, while he was waiting at
the inn where he intended to dine, two young men acco&#383;ted him,
and after engaging him in a general conver&#383;ation for &#383;ome
time, began to talk with great freedom, though with an affected
caution of public men and mea&#383;ures, of the banditti who
governed, the tyranny that was exerci&#383;ed, and the
&#383;upinene&#383;&#383; of the people: in &#383;hort, of all
tho&#383;e too poignant truths which con&#383;titute the leze
nation of the day. Mons. de ____ was not at fir&#383;t very
attentive, but finding their di&#383;cour&#383;e become &#383;till
more liberal, it excited his &#383;u&#383;picions, and ca&#383;ting
his eyes on a gla&#383;s oppo&#383;ite to where they were
conver&#383;ing, he perceived a &#383;ort of intelligence between
them, which immediately &#383;ugge&#383;ted to him the
profe&#383;&#383;ion of his companions; and calling to a couple of
dragoons who had attended him, ordered them to arre&#383;t the two
gentlemen as arti&#383;tocrates, and convey them without ceremony
to pri&#383;on. They &#383;ubmitted, &#383;eemingly more
&#383;urprized than alarmed, and in two hours the General received
a note from a higher power, de&#383;iring him to &#383;et them at
liberty, as they were agents of the republic.</p>
<p>Duque&#383;noy, one of the Repre&#383;entatives now with the
Northern army, i&#383; ignorant and brutal in the extreme. He has
made his brother (who, a&#383; well as him&#383;elf, u&#383;ed to
retail hops in the &#383;treets of St. Pol,) a General; and in
order to deliver him from rivals and critics, he breaks,
&#383;u&#383;pends, arre&#383;ts, and &#383;ends to the Guillotine
every officer of any merit that comes in his way. After the battle
of Maubeuge, he arre&#383;ted a General Bardell, [The Generals
Bardell and D'Ave&#383;nes, and &#383;everal others, were
afterwards guillotined at Paris.] for accommodating a wounded
pri&#383;oner of di&#383;tinction (I think a relation of the Prince
of Cobourg) with a bed, and tore with his own hands the epaulette
from the &#383;houlder&#383; of tho&#383;e Generals who&#383;e
divi&#383;ions had not &#383;u&#383;tained the combat &#383;o well
a&#383; the others. His temper, naturally &#383;avage and choleric,
is irritated to fury by the habit of drinking large quantities of
&#383;trong liquors; and Mad. de ___'s relation a&#383;&#383;ured
us, that he had him&#383;elf &#383;een him take the Mayor of
Ave&#383;nes (a venerable old man, who was pre&#383;enting
&#383;ome petition to him that regarded the town,) by the hair and
throw him on the ground, with the ge&#383;tures of an enraged
cannibal. He al&#383;o confined one of hi&#383; own fellow deputies
in the tower of Gui&#383;e, upon a very frivolous pretext, and
merely on his own authority. In fact, I &#383;carcely remember half
the horrors told us of this man; and I &#383;hall only remind you,
that he has an unlimited controul over the civil con&#383;titution
of the Northern army, and over the whole department of the
North.</p>
<p>You, I &#383;uppo&#383;e, will be better informed of military
events than we are, and I mention our friend's conjecture, that
(be&#383;ides an enormous number of killed) the wounded at Maubeuge
amounted to twelve or fourteen thou&#383;and, only to remark the
deception which is &#383;till practi&#383;ed on the people; for no
publi&#383;hed account ever allowed the number to be more than a
few hundreds.&mdash;Be&#383;ides the&#383;e profe&#383;&#383;ional
details, the General gave u&#383; &#383;ome very unplea&#383;ant
family ones. On returning to his father's chateau, where he hoped
to be taken care of while his wounds were curing, he found every
room in it under &#383;eals, three guards in
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion, his two &#383;i&#383;ter&#383;
arre&#383;ted at St. Omer, where they happened to be on a
vi&#383;it, and hi&#383; father and mother confined in
&#383;eparate hou&#383;es of detention at Arras. After
vi&#383;iting them, and making &#383;ome ineffectual applications
for their relief, he came to the neighbourhood of Dourlens,
expecting to find an a&#383;ylum with an uncle, who had hitherto
e&#383;caped the general per&#383;ecution of the gentry. Here again
his di&#383;appointment and chagrin were renewed: hi&#383; uncle
had been carried off to Amiens the morning of his arrival, and the
hou&#383;e rendered inacce&#383;&#383;ible, by the u&#383;ual
affixture of &#383;eals, and an attendant pair of myrmidons to
guard them from infraction. Thus excluded from all his family
habitations, he had taken up his re&#383;idence for a day or two at
the inn where we met him, his intention being to return to
Arras.</p>
<p>In the morning we made our adieus and pur&#383;ued our journey;
but, tenaciou&#383; of this comparative liberty and the enjoyment
of pure air, we prevailed on our conductors to let us dine on the
road, &#383;o that we lingered with the unwillingne&#383;s of
truant children, and did not reach Amiens until dark. When we
arrived at the Hotel de Ville, one of the guards enquired how we
were to be di&#383;po&#383;ed of. Unfortunately for us, Dumont
happened to be there him&#383;elf, and on hearing we were &#383;ent
from Arras by order of Le Bon, declared mo&#383;t furiou&#383;ly
(for our Repre&#383;entative is &#383;ubject to choler &#383;ince
his acce&#383;&#383;ion to greatne&#383;s) that he would have no
pri&#383;oner&#383; received from Arras, and that we &#383;hould
&#383;leep at the Conciergerie, and be conveyed back again on the
morrow. Terrified at this menace, we per&#383;uaded the guard to
repre&#383;ent to Dumont that we had been &#383;ent to Amiens at
our own in&#383;tance, and that we had been originally
arre&#383;ted by him&#383;elf, and were therefore de&#383;irous of
returning to the department where he was on mi&#383;&#383;ion, and
where we had more rea&#383;on to expect ju&#383;tice than at Arras.
Mollified, perhaps, by this implied preference of his authority, he
con&#383;ented that we &#383;hould remain for the pre&#383;ent at
Amiens, and ordered us to be taken to the Bicetre. Whoever has been
u&#383;ed to connect with the word Bicetre the idea of the
pri&#383;on &#383;o named at Paris, mu&#383;t recoil with horror
upon hearing they are de&#383;tined to &#383;uch a abode. Mad. de
___, yet weak from the remains of her illne&#383;s, laid hold of me
in a tran&#383;port of grief; but, far from being able to calm or
con&#383;ole her, my thoughts were &#383;o bewildered that I did
not, till we alighted at the gate, begin to be really
&#383;en&#383;ible of our &#383;ituation. The night was dark and
dreary, and our fir&#383;t entrance was into a kitchen, &#383;uch
as my imagination had pictured the &#383;ubterraneous one of the
robbers in Gil Blas. Here we underwent the ceremony of having our
pocket-books &#383;earched for papers and letters, and our trunks
rummaged for knives and fire-arms. This done, we were &#383;hown to
the lodging I have de&#383;cribed, and the poor prie&#383;ts,
already in&#383;ufferably crouded, were obliged almo&#383;t to join
their beds in order to make room for us.&mdash;I will not pain you
by a recital of all the embarra&#383;&#383;ments and
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es we had to &#383;urmount before we could
even re&#383;t our&#383;elves. We were in want of every thing, and
the rules of the pri&#383;on &#383;uch, that it was nearly
impo&#383;&#383;ible, for &#383;ome time, to procure any thing: but
the human mind is more flexible than we are often
di&#383;po&#383;ed to imagine it; and in two days we were able to
&#383;ee our &#383;ituation in thi&#383; be&#383;t point of view,
(that is, as an e&#383;cape from Arras,) and the affair of
&#383;ubmitting our bodies to our minds mu&#383;t be atchieved by
time.&mdash;We have now been here a week. We have &#383;ounded the
very depth of humiliation, taken our daily allowance of bread with
the re&#383;t of the pri&#383;oners, and contracted a mo&#383;t
friendly intimacy with the gaoler.</p>
<p>I have di&#383;covered &#383;ince our arrival, that the order
for tran&#383;ferring u&#383; hither de&#383;cribed me as a native
of the Low Countries. I know not how this happened, but my friend
has in&#383;i&#383;ted on my not rectifying the mi&#383;take, for
as the French talk continually of re-conquering Brabant, &#383;he
per&#383;uades her&#383;elf &#383;uch an event would procure me my
liberty. I neither de&#383;ire the one nor expect the other; but,
to indulge her, I &#383;peak no Engli&#383;h, and avoid two or
three of my countrymen who I am told are here. There have been
al&#383;o &#383;ome Engli&#383;h families who were lately removed,
but the French pronounce our names &#383;o &#383;trangely, that I
have not been able to learn who they were.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>November 19, 1793.</h2>
<p>The Engli&#383;h in general, e&#383;pecially of late years, have
been taught to entertain very formidable notions of the
Ba&#383;tille and other &#383;tate pri&#383;on&#383; of the ancient
government, and they were, no doubt, horrid enough; yet I have not
hitherto been able to di&#383;cover that tho&#383;e of the new
republic are any way preferable. The only difference is, that the
great number of pri&#383;oners which, for want of room, are obliged
to be heaped together, makes it impo&#383;&#383;ible to exclude
them as formerly from communication, and, in&#383;tead of being
maintained at the public expence, they now, with great difficulty,
are able to procure wherewithal to eat at their own. Our
pre&#383;ent habitation is an immen&#383;e building, about a
quarter of a mile from the town, intended originally for the common
gaol of the province. The &#383;ituation is damp and
unwhole&#383;ome, and the water &#383;o bad, that I &#383;hould
&#383;uppo&#383;e a long continuance here of &#383;uch a number of
pri&#383;oners mu&#383;t be productive of endemical di&#383;orders.
Every avenue to the hou&#383;e is guarded, and no one is permitted
to &#383;top and look up at the windows, under pain of becoming a
re&#383;ident. We are &#383;trictly prohibited from all external
intercour&#383;e, except by writing; and every &#383;crap of paper,
though but an order for a dinner, pa&#383;&#383;es the
inqui&#383;ition of three different people before it reaches its
de&#383;tination, and, of cour&#383;e, many letters and note&#383;
are mi&#383;laid, and never &#383;ent at all.&mdash;There is no
court or garden in which the pri&#383;oners are allowed to walk,
and the only exerci&#383;e they can take i&#383; in damp
pa&#383;&#383;ages, or a &#383;mall yard, (perhaps thirty feet
&#383;quare,) which often &#383;mells &#383;o dete&#383;tably, that
the atmo&#383;phere of the hou&#383;e it&#383;elf i&#383; le&#383;s
mephitic.</p>
<p>Our fellow-captives are a motley collection of the victims of
nature, of ju&#383;tice, and of tyranny&mdash;of lunatics who are
in&#383;en&#383;ible of their &#383;ituation, of thieves who
de&#383;erve it, and of political criminals who&#383;e guilt is the
accident of birth, the imputation of wealth, or the
profe&#383;&#383;ion of a clergyman. Among the latter is the
Bi&#383;hop of Amiens, whom I recollect to have mentioned in a
former letter. You will wonder why a con&#383;titutional
Bi&#383;hop, once popular with the democratic party, &#383;hould be
thus treated. The real motive was, probably, to degrade in hi&#383;
per&#383;on a mini&#383;ter of religion&mdash;the
o&#383;ten&#383;ible one, a di&#383;pute with Dumont at the Jacobin
club. As the times grew alarming, the Bi&#383;hop, perhaps, thought
it politic to appear at the club, and the Repre&#383;entative
meeting him there one evening, began to interrogate him very rudely
with regard to his opinion of the marriage of prie&#383;ts. M.
Dubois replied, that when it was officially incumbent on him to
explain him&#383;elf, he would do &#383;o, but that he did not
think the club a place for &#383;uch di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ions, or
&#383;omething to this purpo&#383;e. <i>"Tu prevariques
donc!&mdash;Je t'arrete &#383;ur le champ:"</i> ["What, you
prevaricate!&mdash;I arre&#383;t you in&#383;tantly."] the
Bi&#383;hop was accordingly arre&#383;ted at the in&#383;tant, and
conducted to the Bicetre, without even being &#383;uffered to go
home and furni&#383;h him&#383;elf with nece&#383;&#383;aries; and
the &#383;eals being immediately put on his effects, he ha&#383;
never been able to obtain a change of linen and clothes, or any
thing el&#383;e&mdash;this too at a time when the pen&#383;ions of
the clergy are ill paid, and every article of clothing &#383;o dear
as to be almo&#383;t unpurcha&#383;eable by moderate fortunes, and
when tho&#383;e who might otherwi&#383;e be di&#383;po&#383;ed to
aid or accommodate their friends, abandon them through fear of
being implicated in their mi&#383;fortunes.</p>
<p>But the Bi&#383;hop, yet in the vigour of life, is better
capable of enduring the&#383;e hard&#383;hips than mo&#383;t of the
poor prie&#383;ts with whom he is a&#383;&#383;ociated: the greater
number of them are very old men, with venerable grey
lock&#383;&mdash; and their tattered clerical habits, &#383;canty
meals, and wretched beds, give me many an heart-ache. God &#383;end
the con&#383;tant &#383;ight of &#383;o much mi&#383;ery may not
render me callou&#383;!&mdash;It is certain, there are people here,
who, whatever their feelings might have been on this occa&#383;ion
at fir&#383;t, &#383;eem now little affected by it. Tho&#383;e who
are too much familiarized with &#383;cenes of wretchedne&#383;s, as
well as tho&#383;e to whom they are unknown, are not often very
&#383;u&#383;ceptible; and I am &#383;ometimes di&#383;po&#383;ed
to cavil with our natures, that the &#383;ufferings which ought to
excite our benevolence, and the pro&#383;perity that enables us to
relieve them, &#383;hould ever have a contrary effect. Yet this is
&#383;o true, that I have &#383;carcely ever ob&#383;erved even the
poor con&#383;iderate towards each other&mdash;and the rich, if
they are frequently charitable, are not always
compa&#383;&#383;ionate.*</p>

<blockquote>* Our &#383;ituation at the Bicetre, though terrible
for people unu&#383;ed to hard&#383;hips or confinement, and in
fact, wretched as per&#383;onal inconvenience could make it, was
yet Ely&#383;ium, compared to the pri&#383;ons of other
departments. At St. Omer, the pri&#383;oners were frequently
di&#383;turbed at midnight by the entrance of men into their
apartments, who, with the dete&#383;table en&#383;ign of their
order, (red caps,) and pipes in their mouths, came by way of frolic
to &#383;earch their pockets, trunks, &amp;c.&mdash;At Montreuil,
the Mai&#383;ons d'Arret were under the direction of a
Commi&#383;&#383;ary, who&#383;e behaviour to the female
pri&#383;oners was too atrocious for recital&mdash;two young women,
in particular, who refu&#383;ed to purcha&#383;e milder treatment,
were locked up in a room for &#383;eventeen days.&mdash;Soon after
I left Arras, every pri&#383;on became a den of horror. The
mi&#383;erable inhabitants were &#383;ubject to the agents of Le
Bon, who&#383;e avarice, cruelty, and licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s,
were beyond any thing a humane mind can imagine. Sometimes the
hou&#383;es were &#383;uddenly &#383;urrounded by an armed force,
the pri&#383;oner&#383; turned out in the depth of winter for
&#383;everal hours into an open court, during the operation of
robbing them of their pocket-books, buckles, ear-rings, or whatever
article of value they had about them. At other times they were
vi&#383;ited by the &#383;ame military array, and deprived of their
linen and clothes. Their wine and provi&#383;ion&#383; were
likewi&#383;e taken from them in the &#383;ame manner&mdash;wives
were &#383;eparated from their hu&#383;bands, parents from their
children, old men treated with the mo&#383;t &#383;avage barbarity,
and young women with an indecency &#383;till more abominable. All
communication, either by writing or otherwi&#383;e, was often
prohibited for many days together, and an order was once given to
prevent even the entry of provi&#383;ions, which was not revoked
till the pri&#383;oners became ab&#383;olutely
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;ed. At the Hotel Dieu they were forbidden to
draw more than a &#383;ingle jug of water in twenty-four hours. At
the Providence, the well was left three days without a cord, and
when the unfortunate females confined there procured people to beg
water of the neighbours, they were refu&#383;ed, "becau&#383;e it
was for pri&#383;oners, and if Le Bon heard of it he might be
di&#383;plea&#383;ed!" Windows were blocked up, not to prevent
e&#383;cape, but to exclude air; and when the general &#383;carcity
rendered it impo&#383;&#383;ible for the pri&#383;oners to procure
&#383;ufficient food for their &#383;upport, their &#383;mall
portions were dimini&#383;hed at the gate, under pretext of
&#383;earching for letters, &amp;c. &mdash;People, re&#383;pectable
both for their rank and character, were employed to clean the
pri&#383;ons and privies, while their low and in&#383;olent tyrants
looked on and in&#383;ulted them. On an occa&#383;ion when one of
the Mai&#383;ons d'Arrets was on fire, guards were planted round,
with orders to fire upon tho&#383;e that &#383;hould attempt to
e&#383;cape.&mdash;My memory has but too faithfully recorded
the&#383;e and &#383;till greater horrors; but curio&#383;ity would
be gratified but too dearly by the relation. I added the above note
&#383;ome months after writing the letter to which it is
annexed.</blockquote>

<h2>Nov. 20.</h2>
<p>Be&#383;ides the gentry and clergy of this department, we have
likewi&#383;e for companions a number of inhabitants of Li&#383;le,
arre&#383;ted under circum&#383;tance&#383; &#383;ingularly
atrocious, even where atrocity is the characteri&#383;tic of
almo&#383;t every proceeding.&mdash;In the month of Augu&#383;t a
decree was pa&#383;&#383;ed to oblige all the nobility, clergy, and
their &#383;ervants, as well as all tho&#383;e per&#383;ons who had
been in the &#383;ervice of emigrants, to depart from Li&#383;le in
eight-and-forty hours, and prohibiting their re&#383;idence within
twenty leagues from the frontiers. Thus bani&#383;hed from their
own habitations, they took refuge in different towns, at the
pre&#383;cribed di&#383;tance; but, almo&#383;t as &#383;oon as
they were arrived, and had been at the expence of &#383;ettling
them&#383;elves, they were arre&#383;ted as &#383;trangers,* and
conducted to pri&#383;on.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I have before, I believe, noticed that the term
e&#383;tranger at thi&#383; time did not exclu&#383;ively apply to
foreigners, but to &#383;uch as had come from one town to another,
who were at inns or on a vi&#383;it to their friends.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It will not be improper to notice here the conduct of the
government towards the towns that have been be&#383;ieged.
Thionville,* to who&#383;e gallant defence in 1792 France owed the
retreat of the Pru&#383;&#383;ians and the &#383;afety of Paris,
was afterwards continually reproached with ari&#383;tocracy; and
when the inhabitants &#383;ent a deputation to &#383;olicit an
indemnity for the damage the town had &#383;u&#383;tained during
the bombardment a member of the Convention threatened them from the
tribune with "indemnities a coup de baton!" that is, in our
vernacular tongue, with a good thra&#383;hing.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Wimp&#383;en, who commanded there, and who&#383;e
conduct at the time wa&#383; enthu&#383;ia&#383;tically admired,
was driven, mo&#383;t probably by the ingratitude and ill treatment
of the Convention, to head a party of the
Foederali&#383;ts.&mdash;The&#383;e legi&#383;lators perpetually
boa&#383;t of imitating and &#383;urpa&#383;&#383;ing the Romans,
and it is certain, that their ingratitude has made more than one
Coriolanus. The difference is, that they are not jealous for the
liberty of the country, but for their own per&#383;onal
&#383;afety.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The inhabitants of Li&#383;le, who had been equally
&#383;erviceable in &#383;topping the progre&#383;s of the
Au&#383;trians, for a long time petitioned without effect to obtain
the &#383;ums already voted for their relief. The
noble&#383;&#383;e, and others from thence who have been
arre&#383;ted, as &#383;oon as it was known that they were Lillois,
were treated with peculiar rigour;* and an <i>armee
revolutionnaire,</i>** with the Guillotine for a &#383;tandard, has
lately harra&#383;&#383;ed the town and environs of Li&#383;le, as
though it were a conquered country.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The Commandant of Li&#383;le, on his arrival at the
Bicetre, wa&#383; &#383;tripped of a con&#383;iderable &#383;um of
money, and a quantity of plate he had unluckily brought with him by
way of &#383;ecurity. Out of this he is to be &#383;upplied with
fifty livres at a time in paper, which, according to the exchange
and the price of every thing, is, I &#383;uppo&#383;e, about half a
guinea. ** The armee revolutionnaire was fir&#383;t rai&#383;ed by
order of the Jacobins, for the purpo&#383;e of &#383;earching the
countries for provi&#383;ions, and conducting them to Paris. Under
this pretext, a levy was made of all the mo&#383;t de&#383;perate
ruffians that could be collected together. They were divided into
companies, each with its attendant Guillotine, and then
di&#383;tributed in the different departments: they had
extraordinary pay, and &#383;eem to have been &#383;ubject to no
di&#383;cipline. Many of them were di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by the
repre&#383;entation of a Guillotine in miniature, and a head
ju&#383;t &#383;evered, on their cartouch-boxes. It would be
impo&#383;&#383;ible to de&#383;cribe half the enormities committed
by the&#383;e banditti: wherever they went they were regarded as a
&#383;courge, and every heart &#383;hrunk at their approach.
Lecointre, of Ver&#383;ailles, a member of the Convention,
complained that a band of the&#383;e wretches entered the
hou&#383;e of a farmer, one of his tenants, by night, and, after
binding the family hand and foot, and helping them&#383;elves to
whatever they could find, they placed the farmer with his bare feet
on the chaffing-di&#383;h of hot a&#383;hes, by way of forcing him
to di&#383;cover where he had &#383;ecreted his plate and money,
which having &#383;ecured, they &#383;et all the ve&#383;&#383;els
of liquor running, and then retired.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You are not to &#383;uppo&#383;e this a robbery, and the actors
common thieves; all was in the u&#383;ual form&mdash;"au nom de la
loi," and for the &#383;ervice of the republic; and I do not
mention this in&#383;tance as remarkable, otherwi&#383;e than as
having been noticed in the Convention. A thou&#383;and events of
thi&#383; kind, even &#383;till more atrocious, have happened; but
the &#383;ufferers who had not the means of defence as well as of
complaint, were obliged, through policy, to be &#383;ilent.</p>
<p>&mdash;The garri&#383;on and national guard, indignant at the
horrors they committed, obliged them to decamp. Even the people of
Dunkirk, who&#383;e re&#383;i&#383;tance to the Engli&#383;h, while
the French army was collecting together for their relief, was
perhaps of more con&#383;equence than ten victories, have been
&#383;ince intimidated with Commi&#383;&#383;ioners, and Tribunals,
and Guillotines, as much as if they had been convicted of
&#383;elling the town. In &#383;hort, under this philanthropic
republic, per&#383;ecution &#383;eems to be very exactly
proportioned to the &#383;ervices rendered. A jealous and
&#383;u&#383;piciou&#383; government does not forget, that the
&#383;ame energy of character which ha&#383; enabled a people to
defend them&#383;elves again&#383;t an external enemy, may
al&#383;o make them le&#383;s &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive to
dome&#383;tic oppre&#383;&#383;ion; and, far from repaying them
with the gratitude to which they have a claim, it treats them, on
all occa&#383;ions, as opponents, whom it both fears and hates.</p>
<p>Nov. 22. We have been walking in the yard to-day with General
Laveneur, who, for an act which in any other country would have
gained him credit, is in this &#383;u&#383;pended from his
command.&mdash;When Cu&#383;tine, a few weeks before his death,
left the army to vi&#383;it &#383;ome of the neighbouring towns,
the command devolved on Laveneur, who received, along with other
official papers, a li&#383;t of counter&#383;igns, which, having
probably been made &#383;ome time, and not altered conformably to
the changes of the day, contained, among others, the words
Condorcet&mdash;Con&#383;titution; and the&#383;e were in their
turn given out. On Cu&#383;tine's trial, this was made a part of
hi&#383; accu&#383;ation. Laveneur, recollecting that the
circum&#383;tance had happened in the ab&#383;ence of Cu&#383;tine,
thought it incumbent on him to take the blame, if there were any,
on him&#383;elf, and wrote to Paris to explain the matter a&#383;
it really &#383;tood; but his candour, without availing
Cu&#383;tine, drew per&#383;ecution on him&#383;elf, and the only
notice taken of his letter was an order to arre&#383;t him. After
being dragged from one town to another, like a criminal, and often
lodged in dungeons and common pri&#383;ons, he was at length
depo&#383;ited here.</p>
<p>I know not if the General's principles are republican, but he
has a very democratic pair of whi&#383;kers, which he
occa&#383;ionally &#383;trokes, and &#383;eems to cheri&#383;h with
much affection. He is, however, a gentleman-like man, and
expre&#383;&#383;es &#383;uch anxiety for the fate of his wife and
children, who are now at Paris, that one cannot but be
intere&#383;ted in his favour.&mdash;As the agent&#383; of the
republic never err on the &#383;ide of omi&#383;&#383;ion, they
arre&#383;ted Mons. Laveneur's aid-de-camp with him; and another
officer of his acquaintance, who was &#383;u&#383;pended, and
living at Amiens, has &#383;hared the &#383;ame fate, only for
endeavouring to procure him a trifling accommodation. This
gentleman called on Dumont, to beg that General Laveneur's
&#383;ervant might be permitted to go in and out of the pri&#383;on
on his ma&#383;ter's errands. After breakfa&#383;ting together, and
conver&#383;ing on very civil terms, Dumont told him, that as he
concerned him&#383;elf &#383;o much in behalf of his friend, he
would &#383;end him to keep the latter company, and at the
conclu&#383;ion of hi&#383; vi&#383;it he was &#383;ent
pri&#383;oner to the Bicetre.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greater part of between three and four hundred
thou&#383;and people, now impri&#383;oned on &#383;u&#383;picion,
have been arre&#383;ted for rea&#383;ons a&#383; little
&#383;ub&#383;tantial.</p>
<p>&mdash;I begin to fear my health will not re&#383;i&#383;t the
hard&#383;hip of a long continuance here. We have no fire-place,
and are &#383;ometimes &#383;tarved with partial winds from the
doors and roof; at others faint and heart&#383;ick with the
unhealthy air produced by &#383;o many living bodies. The water we
drink is not preferable to the air we breathe; the bread (which is
now every where &#383;carce and bad) contains &#383;uch a mixture
of barley, rye, damaged wheat, and tra&#383;h of all kinds, that,
far from being nouri&#383;hed by it, I lo&#383;e both my
&#383;trength and appetite daily.&mdash;Yet the&#383;e are not the
wor&#383;t of our &#383;ufferings. Shut out from all &#383;ociety,
victims of a de&#383;potic and unprincipled government capable of
every thing, and ignorant of the fate which may await us, we are
occa&#383;ionally oppre&#383;&#383;ed by a thou&#383;and melancholy
apprehen&#383;ions. I might, indeed, have boa&#383;ted of my
fortitude, and have made my&#383;elf an heroine on paper at as
&#383;mall an expence of words as it has co&#383;t me to record my
cowardice: but I am of an unlucky conformation, and think either
too much or too little (I know not which) for a female
philo&#383;opher; be&#383;ides, philo&#383;ophy is getting into
&#383;uch ill repute, that not po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing the
reality, the name of it is not worth a&#383;&#383;uming.</p>
<p>A poor old prie&#383;t told me ju&#383;t now, (while Angelique
was mending hi&#383; black coat with white thread,) that they had
left at the place where they were la&#383;t confined a large
quantity of linen, and other nece&#383;&#383;aries; but, by the
expre&#383;s orders of Dumont, they were not allowed to bring a
&#383;ingle article away with them. The keeper, too, it &#383;eems,
was threatened with di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ion, for &#383;upplying
one of them with a &#383;hirt.&mdash;In England, where, I believe,
you ally political expediency as much as you can with ju&#383;tice
and humanity, the&#383;e cruelties, at once little and refined,
will appear incredible; and the French them&#383;elves, who are at
lea&#383;t a&#383;hamed of, if they are not pained by, them, are
obliged to &#383;eek refuge in the fancied palliative of a
"&#383;tate of revolution."&mdash;Yet, admitting the
nece&#383;&#383;ity of confining the per&#383;ons of the&#383;e old
men, there can be none for heaping them together in filth and
mi&#383;ery, and adding to the &#383;ufferings of year&#383; and
infirmity by tho&#383;e of cold and want. If, indeed, a &#383;tate
of revolution require &#383;uch deeds, and imply an apology for
them, I cannot but wi&#383;h the French had remained as they were,
for I know of no political changes that can compen&#383;ate for
turning a civilized nation into a people of &#383;avages. It is not
&#383;urely the eating acorns or ragouts, a well-powdered head, or
one decorated with red feathers, that con&#383;titute&#383; the
difference between barbari&#383;m and civilization; and, I fear, if
the French proceed as they have begun, the advantage of morals will
be con&#383;iderably on the &#383;ide of the unrefined
&#383;avages.</p>
<p>The conver&#383;ation of the pri&#383;on has been much engaged
by the fate of an Engli&#383;h gentleman, who lately de&#383;troyed
him&#383;elf in a Mai&#383;on d'Arret at Amiens. His confinement
had at fir&#383;t deeply affected his &#383;pirits, and his
melancholy increa&#383;ing at the pro&#383;pect of a long
detention, terminated in deranging his mind, and occa&#383;ioned
this la&#383;t act of de&#383;pair.&mdash;I never hear of
&#383;uicide without a compa&#383;&#383;ion mingled with terror,
for, perhaps, &#383;imple pity is too light an emotion to be
excited by an event which reminds us, that we are
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of a degree of mi&#383;ery too great to be
borne&mdash;too &#383;trong for the efforts of in&#383;tinct,
reflection, and religion. &mdash;I could moralize on the
nece&#383;&#383;ity of habitual patience, and the benefit of
preparing the mind for great evils by a philo&#383;ophic endurance
of little ones; but I am at the Bicetre&mdash;the winds
whi&#383;tle round me&mdash;I am be&#383;et by petty
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es, and we do not expatiate to advantage on
endurance while we have any thing to endure.&mdash;Seneca's
contempt for the things of this world was doubtle&#383;s
&#383;ugge&#383;ted in the palace of Nero. He would not have
treated the &#383;ubject &#383;o well in di&#383;grace and poverty.
Do not &#383;uppo&#383;e I am affecting to be plea&#383;ant, for I
write in the &#383;ober &#383;adne&#383;s of conviction, that human
fortitude is often no better than a pompous theory, founded on
&#383;elf-love and &#383;elf-deception.</p>
<p>I was &#383;urprized at meeting among our fellow-pri&#383;oners
a number of Dutch officers. I find they had been &#383;ome time in
the town on their parole, and were &#383;ent here by Dumont, for
refu&#383;ing to permit their men to work on the
fortifications.&mdash;The French government and its agents
de&#383;pi&#383;e the laws of war hitherto ob&#383;erved; they
con&#383;ider them as a &#383;ort of ari&#383;tocratie militaire,
and they pretend, on the &#383;ame principle, to be
enfranchi&#383;ed from the law of nations.&mdash;An orator of the
convention lately boa&#383;ted, that he felt him&#383;elf
infinitely &#383;uperior to the prejudices of Grotius, Puffendorff,
and Vatel, which he calls "l'ari&#383;tocratie
diplomatique."&mdash;Such &#383;ublime &#383;pirits think,
becau&#383;e they differ from the re&#383;t of mankind, that they
&#383;urpa&#383;s them. Like Icarus, they attempt to fly, and are
perpetually &#383;truggling in the mire.&mdash;Plain common
&#383;en&#383;e ha&#383; long pointed out a rule of action, from
which all deviation is fatal, both to nations and individuals.
England, as well as France, ha&#383; furni&#383;hed its examples;
and the annals of genius in all countries are replete with the
mi&#383;eries of eccentricity.&mdash;Whoever has followed the
cour&#383;e of the French revolution, will, I believe, be
convinced, that the greate&#383;t evils attending on it have been
occa&#383;ioned by an affected contempt for received maxims. A
common banditti, acting only from the de&#383;ire of plunder, or
men, erring only through ignorance, could not have &#383;ubjugated
an whole people, had they not been a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted by
narrow-minded philo&#383;ophers, who were eager to &#383;acrifice
their country to the vanity of making experiments, and were little
&#383;olicitous whether their &#383;y&#383;tems were good or bad,
provided they were celebrated as the authors of them. Yet, where
are they now? Wandering, pro&#383;cribed, and trembling at the fate
of their followers and accomplices.&mdash;The Bri&#383;&#383;otins,
&#383;acrificed by a party even wor&#383;e than them&#383;elves,
have died without exciting either pity or admiration. Their fall
was con&#383;idered as the natural con&#383;equence of their
exaltation, and the courage with which they met death obtained no
tribute but a cold and &#383;imple comment,
undi&#383;tingui&#383;hed from the news of the day, and ending with
it.</p>

<h2>December.</h2>
<p>La&#383;t night, after we had been a&#383;leep about an hour,
(for habit, that "lulls the wet &#383;ea-boy on the high and giddy
ma&#383;t," has reconciled us to &#383;leep even here,) we were
alarmed by the trampling of feet, and &#383;udden unlocking of our
door. Our apprehen&#383;ions gave us no time for conjecture
&mdash;in a moment an ill-looking fellow entered the room with a
lantern, two &#383;oldiers holding drawn &#383;words, and a large
dog! The whole company walked as it were proce&#383;&#383;ionally
to the end of the apartment, and, after ob&#383;erving in
&#383;ilence the beds on each &#383;ide, left us. It would not be
ea&#383;y to de&#383;cribe what we &#383;uffered at this moment:
for my own part, I thought only of the ma&#383;&#383;acres of
September, and the frequent propo&#383;als at the Jacobins and the
Convention for di&#383;patching the <i>"gens
&#383;u&#383;pect,"</i> and really concluded I was going to
terminate my exi&#383;tence <i>"revolutionnairement."</i> I do not
now know the purport of the&#383;e vi&#383;its, but I find they are
not unu&#383;ual, and mo&#383;t probably intended to alarm the
pri&#383;oners.</p>
<p>After many enquiries and me&#383;&#383;ages, I have had the
mortification of hearing that Mr. and Mrs. D____ were taken to
Arras, and were there even before I left it. The letters &#383;ent
to and from the different pri&#383;ons are read by &#383;o many
people, and pa&#383;s through &#383;o many hands, that it is not
&#383;urprizing we have not heard from each other. As far as I can
learn, they had obtained leave, after their fir&#383;t arre&#383;t,
to remove to a hou&#383;e in the vicinity of Dourlens for a few
days, on account of Mrs. D____'&#383; health, which had
&#383;uffered by pa&#383;&#383;ing the &#383;ummer in the town, and
that at the taking of Toulon they were again arre&#383;ted while on
a vi&#383;it, and conveyed to a <i>Mai&#383;on d'Arret</i> at
Arras. I am the more anxious for them, as it &#383;eems they were
unprepared for &#383;uch an event; and as the &#383;eals were put
upon their effects, I fear they mu&#383;t be in want of every
thing. I might, perhaps, have &#383;ucceeded in getting them
removed here, but Fleury'&#383; Arras friend, it &#383;eems, did
not think, when the Convention had aboli&#383;hed every other part
of Chri&#383;tianity, that they intended &#383;till to exact a
partial ob&#383;ervance of the eighth article of the decalogue; and
having, in the &#383;en&#383;e of Antient Pi&#383;tol, "conveyed" a
little too notoriou&#383;ly, Le Bon has, by way of &#383;ecuring
him from notice or pur&#383;uit, &#383;ent him to the frontiers in
the capacity of Commi&#383;&#383;ary.</p>
<p>The pri&#383;on, con&#383;idering how many French inhabitants it
contains, i&#383; tolerably quiet&mdash;to &#383;ay the truth, we
are not very &#383;ociable, and &#383;till le&#383;s gay. Common
intere&#383;t e&#383;tabli&#383;hes a &#383;ort of intimacy between
tho&#383;e of the &#383;ame apartment; but the re&#383;t of the
hou&#383;e pa&#383;s each other, without farther intercour&#383;e
than &#383;ilent though &#383;ignificant civility. Sometime&#383;
you &#383;ee a pair of unfortunate ari&#383;tocrates talking
politics at the end of a pa&#383;&#383;age, or on a landing-place;
and here and there a bevy of females, en de&#383;habille,
recounting altogether the &#383;ubject of their arre&#383;t.
One'&#383; ear occa&#383;ionally catches a few
half-&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed notes of a pro&#383;cribed aire, but
the unhallowed &#383;ounds of the Carmagnole and Mar&#383;eillois
are never heard, and would be thought more di&#383;&#383;onant here
than the war-whoop. In fact, the only appearance of gaiety is among
the ideots and lunatics. &mdash;<i>"Je m'ennuye
furieu&#383;ement,"</i> is the general exclamation.&mdash;An
Engli&#383;hman confined at the Bicetre would expre&#383;s
him&#383;elf more forcibly, but, it i&#383; certain, the want of
knowing how to employ them&#383;elves does not form a &#383;mall
part of the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es of our fellow-pri&#383;oners;
and when they tell us they are <i>"ennuyes,"</i> they &#383;ay,
perhaps, nearly as much as they feel&mdash; for, as far as I can
ob&#383;erve, the lo&#383;s of liberty has not the &#383;ame effect
on a Frenchman as an Engli&#383;hman. Whether this ari&#383;es from
political cau&#383;es, or the natural indifference of the French
character, I am not qualified to determine; probably from both: yet
when I ob&#383;erve thi&#383; facility of mind general, and by no
means peculiar to the higher cla&#383;&#383;es, I cannot
my&#383;elf but be of opinion, that it is more an effect of their
original di&#383;po&#383;ition than of their form of government;
for though in England we were accu&#383;tomed from our childhood to
con&#383;ider every man in France as liable to wake and find
him&#383;elf in the Ba&#383;tille, or at Mont St. Michel, this
formidable de&#383;poti&#383;m exi&#383;ted more in theory than in
practice; and if courtiers and men of letters were intimidated by
it, the ma&#383;s of the people troubled them&#383;elves very
little about Lettres de Cachet. The revenge or &#383;u&#383;picion
of Mini&#383;ters might &#383;ometimes pur&#383;ue tho&#383;e who
aimed at their power, or a&#383;&#383;ailed their reputation; but
the le&#383;&#383;er gentry, the merchants, or the
&#383;hopkeepers, were very &#383;eldom victims of arbitrary
impri&#383;onment&mdash;and I believe, among&#383;t the evils which
it was the object of the revolution to redre&#383;s, this (except
on the principle) was far from being of the fir&#383;t magnitude. I
am not likely, under my pre&#383;ent circum&#383;tances, to be an
advocate for the de&#383;poti&#383;m of any form of government; and
I only give it as a matter of opinion, that the civil liberty of
the French was not &#383;o often and generally violated,* as to
influence their character in &#383;uch a degree as to render them
in&#383;en&#383;ible of its lo&#383;s. At any rate, we mu&#383;t
rank it among the <i>bizarrerie&#383;</i> [Unaccountable
whim&#383;ical events.] of this world, that the French &#383;hould
have been prepared, by the theory of oppre&#383;&#383;ion under
their old &#383;y&#383;tem, for enduring the practice of it under
the new one; and that what during the monarchy was only
po&#383;&#383;ible to a few, is, under the republic, almo&#383;t
certain to all.</p>

to believe that this tremendou&#383; pri&#383;on was peopled with
victims, and that even the dungeons were inhabited; yet the truth
is, though it would not have told &#383;o pathetically, or have
produced &#383;o much theatrical effect, there were only &#383;even
per&#383;ons confined in the whole building, and certainly not one
in the dungeons.</blockquote>

<h2>Amiens, Providence, Dec. 10, 1793.</h2>
<p>We have again, as you will perceive, changed our abode, and that
too without expecting, and almo&#383;t without de&#383;iring it. In
my moments of &#383;ullenne&#383;s and de&#383;pondency, I was not
very &#383;olicitous about the modifications of our confinement,
and little di&#383;po&#383;ed to be better &#383;ati&#383;fied with
one pri&#383;on than another: but, heroics apart, external comforts
are of &#383;ome importance, and we have, in many re&#383;pects,
gained by our removal.</p>
<p>Our pre&#383;ent habitation is a &#383;pacious building, lately
a convent, and though now crouded with more pri&#383;oners by two
or three hundred than it will hold conveniently, yet we are better
lodged than at the Bicetre, and we have al&#383;o a large garden,
good water, and, what above all i&#383; de&#383;irable, the liberty
of delivering our letters or me&#383;&#383;ages our&#383;elve&#383;
(in pre&#383;ence of the guard) to any one who will venture to
approach us. Mad. de ____ and my&#383;elf have a &#383;mall cell,
where we have ju&#383;t room to place our beds, but we have no
fire-place, and the maids are obliged to &#383;leep in an adjoining
pa&#383;&#383;age.</p>
<p>A few evenings ago, while we were at the Bicetre, we were
&#383;uddenly informed by the keeper that Dumont had &#383;ent
&#383;ome &#383;oldiers with an order to convey us that night to
the Providence. We were at fir&#383;t rather &#383;urprized than
plea&#383;ed, and reluctantly gathered our baggage together with as
much expedition as we could, while the men who were to e&#383;cort
u&#383; were exclaiming "a la Francai&#383;e" at the trifling delay
this occa&#383;ioned. When we had pa&#383;&#383;ed the gate, we
found Fleury, with &#383;ome porters, ready to receive our beds,
and overjoyed at having procured us a more decent pri&#383;on, for,
it &#383;eems, he could by no means reconcile him&#383;elf to the
name of Bicetre. We had about half a mile to walk, and on the road
he contrived to acquaint us with the means by which he had
&#383;olicited thi&#383; favour of Dumont. After advi&#383;ing with
all Mad. de ____'s friends who were yet at liberty, and finding no
one willing to make an effort in her behalf, for fear of involving
them&#383;elves, he di&#383;covered an old acquaintance in the
"femme de chambre" of one of Fleury's
mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es.&mdash; This, for one of Fleury's
&#383;agacity, was a &#383;pring to have &#383;et the whole
Convention in a ferment; and in a few days he profited &#383;o well
by thi&#383; female patronage, as to obtain an order for
tran&#383;ferring us hither. On our arrival, we were informed, as
u&#383;ual, that the hou&#383;e was already full, and that there
was no po&#383;&#383;ibility of admitting us. We however, &#383;et
up all night in the keeper's room with &#383;ome other people newly
arrived like our&#383;elves, and in the morning, after a little
di&#383;puting and a pretty general derangement of the more ancient
inhabitants, we were "nichees," as I have de&#383;cribed to
you.</p>
<p>We have not yet quitted our room much, but I ob&#383;erve that
every one appears more chearful, and more &#383;tudied in their
toilette, than at the Bicetre, and I am willing to infer from
thence that confinement here i&#383; le&#383;s
in&#383;upportable.&mdash;I have been employed two days in
enlarging the note&#383; I had made in our la&#383;t pri&#383;on,
and in making them more legible, for I ventured no farther than
ju&#383;t to &#383;cribble with a pencil in a kind of
&#383;hort-hand of my own invention, and not even that without a
variety of precautions. I &#383;hall be here le&#383;s liable
either to &#383;urprize or ob&#383;ervation, and as &#383;oon as I
have &#383;ecured what I have already noted, (which I intend to do
to-night,) I &#383;hall continue my remarks in the u&#383;ual form.
You will find even more than my cu&#383;tomary incorrectne&#383;s
and want of method &#383;ince we left Peronne; but I &#383;hall not
allow your competency a&#383; a critic, until you have been a
pri&#383;oner in the hands of French republicans.</p>
<p>It will not be improper to notice to you a very ingenious decree
of Ga&#383;ton, (a member of the Convention,) who lately
propo&#383;ed to embark all the Engli&#383;h now in France at
Bre&#383;t, and then to &#383;ink the
&#383;hips.&mdash;Perhap&#383; the Committee of Public Welfare are
now in a &#383;ort of benevolent indeci&#383;ion, whether this, or
Collot d'Herboi&#383;' gunpowder &#383;cheme, &#383;hall have the
preference. Legendre's iron cage and &#383;imple hanging will,
doubtle&#383;s, be rejected, as too &#383;low and formal. The mode
of the day i&#383; "les grandes me&#383;ures." If I be not
&#383;eriou&#383;ly alarmed at the&#383;e propo&#383;itions, it is
not that life is indifferent to me, or that I think the government
too humane to adopt them. My tranquillity ari&#383;es from
reflecting that &#383;uch mea&#383;ures would be of no political
u&#383;e, and that we &#383;hall mo&#383;t likely be &#383;oon
forgotten in the multitude of more important concerns. Tho&#383;e,
however, whom I endeavour to con&#383;ole by this rea&#383;oning,
tell me it is nothing le&#383;s than infallible, that the inutility
of a crime is here no &#383;ecurity again&#383;t its perpetration,
and that any project which tends to evil will &#383;ooner be
remembered than one of humanity or ju&#383;tice.</p>

<h2>Providence, Dec. 20, 1793.</h2>
<p>"All places that are vi&#383;ited by the eye of Heaven, are to
the wi&#383;e man happy havens." If Shak&#383;peare's
philo&#383;ophy be orthodox, the French have, it mu&#383;t be
confe&#383;&#383;ed, many claims to the reputation of a wi&#383;e
people; and though you know I always di&#383;puted their
preten&#383;ions to general gaiety, yet I acknowledge that
mi&#383;fortune does not deprive them of the &#383;hare they
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s, and, if one may judge by appearances, they
have at lea&#383;t the habit, more than any other nation, of
finding content under &#383;ituation&#383; with which it
&#383;hould &#383;eem incompatible. We are here between &#383;ix
and &#383;even hundred, of all ages and of all ranks, taken from
our homes, and from all that u&#383;ually makes the comfort of
life, and crowded together under many of the inflictions that
con&#383;titute its mi&#383;ery; yet, in the mid&#383;t of all
this, we fiddle, dre&#383;s, rhyme, and vi&#383;it as
ceremoniou&#383;ly a&#383; though we had nothing to di&#383;turb
us. Our beaux, after being correctly frizz'd and powdered behind
&#383;ome door, compliment the belle ju&#383;t e&#383;caped from a
toilet, performed amid&#383;t the apparatus of the kitchen; three
or four beds are piled one upon another to make room for as many
card-tables; and the wits of the pri&#383;on, who are all the
morning employed in writing doleful placets to obtain their
liberty, in the evening celebrate the lo&#383;s of it in
bout-rimees and acro&#383;tics.</p>
<p>I &#383;aw an a&#383;s at the <i>Corps de Garde</i> this morning
laden with violins and mu&#383;ic, and a female pri&#383;oner
&#383;eldom arrives without her complement of
bandboxes.&mdash;Embarra&#383;&#383;ed, &#383;tifled as we are by
our numbers, it does not prevent a daily importation of lap-dogs,
who form as con&#383;equential a part of the community in a
pri&#383;on, as in the mo&#383;t &#383;uperb hotel. The faithful
valet, who has followed the fortunes of his ma&#383;ter, does not
&#383;o much &#383;hare his di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es as contribute
to his plea&#383;ure by adorning hi&#383; per&#383;on, or, rather,
his head, for, excepting the article of hair-dre&#383;&#383;ing,
the beaux here are not elaborate. In &#383;hort, there is an
indifference, a frivolity, in the French character, which, in
circum&#383;tances like the pre&#383;ent, appears unaccountable.
But man is not always con&#383;i&#383;tent with him&#383;elf, and
there are occa&#383;ions in which the French are nothing le&#383;s
than philo&#383;ophers. Under all the&#383;e externals of levity,
they are a very prudent people, and though they &#383;eem to bear
with infinite fortitude many of the evils of life, there are
&#383;ome in which their &#383;en&#383;ibility is not to be
que&#383;tioned. At the death of a relation, or the lo&#383;s of
liberty, I have ob&#383;erved that a few hour&#383; &#383;uffice,
<i>pour prendre &#383;on parti;</i> [To make up his mind.] but on
any occa&#383;ion where his fortune has &#383;uffered, the
livelie&#383;t Frenchman is <i>au de&#383;e&#383;poir</i> for whole
days. Whenever any thing is to be lo&#383;t or gained, all his
characteri&#383;tic indifference vani&#383;hes, and his attention
become&#383; mentally concentrated, without di&#383;&#383;ipating
the habitual &#383;mile of hi&#383; countenance. He may
&#383;ometimes be deceived through deficiency of judgment, but I
believe not often by unguardedne&#383;s; and, in a matter of
intere&#383;t, a <i>petit maitre</i> of five-and-twenty might
<i>tout en badinage</i> [All in the way of plea&#383;antry.]
maintain his ground again&#383;t a whole &#383;ynagogue.&mdash;This
di&#383;po&#383;ition is not remarkable only in affairs that may be
&#383;uppo&#383;ed to require it, but extends to the minute&#383;t
objects; and the &#383;ame oeconomy which watches over the
ma&#383;s of a Frenchman's e&#383;tate, guards with equal
&#383;olicitude the menu property of a log of wood, or a hen's
ne&#383;t.</p>
<p>There is at this moment a general &#383;carcity of
provi&#383;ions, and we who are confined are, of cour&#383;e,
particularly inconvenienced by it; we do not even get bread that is
eatable, and it is curious to ob&#383;erve with what
circum&#383;pection every one talks of his re&#383;ources. The
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;or of a few eggs takes care not to
expo&#383;e them to the eye of his neighbour; and a &#383;lice of
white bread is a donation of &#383;o much con&#383;equence, that
tho&#383;e who procure any for them&#383;elves do not often put
their friends to the pain either of accepting or refu&#383;ing
it.</p>
<p>Mad. de ____ has been unwell for &#383;ome days, and I could not
help giving a hint to a relation of her's whom we found here, and
who has frequent &#383;upplies of bread from the country, that the
bread we eat was peculiarly inimical to her; but I gained only a
look of repul&#383;ive apprehen&#383;ion, and a cold remark that it
was very difficult to get good bread&mdash;<i>"et que c'etoit bien
malheureux."</i> [And that it certainly was very unfortunate.] I
own this kind of &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s is increa&#383;ed by a
&#383;ituation where our wants are numerous, and our enjoyments
few; and the great di&#383;tinctions of meum and tuum, which at all
times have occa&#383;ioned &#383;o much bad fellow&#383;hip in the
world, are here perhaps more rigidly ob&#383;erved than any where
el&#383;e; yet, in my opinion, a clo&#383;e-hearted
con&#383;ideration has always formed an e&#383;&#383;ential and a
predominant quality in the French character.</p>
<p>People here do not ruin them&#383;elves, as with us, by
ho&#383;pitality; and examples of that thoughtle&#383;s
profu&#383;ion which we cen&#383;ure and regret, without being able
entirely to condemn, are very rare indeed. In France it is not
uncommon to &#383;ee a man apparently di&#383;&#383;ipated in his
conduct, and licentious in his morals, yet regular, even to
par&#383;imony, in hi&#383; pecuniary concerns.&mdash;He
oeconomizes with his vices, and indulges in all the
exce&#383;&#383;es of fa&#383;hionable life, with the &#383;ame
&#383;y&#383;tem of order that accumulates the fortune of a Dutch
mi&#383;er. Lord Che&#383;terfield wa&#383; doubtle&#383;s
&#383;ati&#383;fied, that while his &#383;on remained in France,
his precept&#383; would have all the benefit of living
illu&#383;tration; yet it is not certain that this cautious and
reflecting licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s has any merit over the more
imprudent irregularity of an Engli&#383;h &#383;pendthrift: the one
is, however, likely to be more durable than the other; and, in
fact, the character of an old libertine is more frequent in France
than in England.</p>
<p>If oeconomy pre&#383;ide even over the vices of the rich and
fa&#383;hionable, you may conclude that the habits of the middling
ranks of people of &#383;mall fortunes are &#383;till more
&#383;crupulou&#383;ly &#383;ubjected to its influence. A French
<i>menage</i> [Hou&#383;ehold.] is a practical treati&#383;e on the
art of &#383;aving&mdash;a &#383;pirit of oeconomy pervades and
directs every part of it, and that &#383;o uniformly, &#383;o
generally, and &#383;o con&#383;i&#383;tently, as not to make the
&#383;ame impre&#383;&#383;ion on a &#383;tranger as would a
&#383;ingle in&#383;tance where the whole was not conducted on the
&#383;ame principle. A traveller is not &#383;o forcibly
&#383;tricken by this part of the French character, becau&#383;e it
is more real than apparent, and does not &#383;eem the effect of
rea&#383;oning or effort, which is never con&#383;equential, but
rather that of inclination and the natural cour&#383;e of
things.</p>
<p>A degree of par&#383;imony, which an Engli&#383;hman, who does
not affect the reputation of a Codrus, could not acquire without
many &#383;elf-combats, appears in a Frenchman a matter of
preference and convenience, and till one has lived long and
familiarly in the country, one is apt to mi&#383;take principles
for cu&#383;toms, and character for manners, and to attribute many
things to local which have their real &#383;ource in moral
cau&#383;es.&mdash;The traveller who &#383;ees nothing but gay
furniture, and gay clothes, and partakes on invitation of
&#383;plendid repa&#383;ts, returns to England the enamoured
panegyri&#383;t of French ho&#383;pitality.&mdash;On a longer
re&#383;idence and more dome&#383;tic intercour&#383;e, all this is
di&#383;coverable to be merely the &#383;acrifice of par&#383;imony
to vanity&mdash;the &#383;olid comforts of life are unknown, and
ho&#383;pitality &#383;eldom extends beyond an occa&#383;ional and
o&#383;tentatiou&#383; reception. The gilding, painting,
gla&#383;&#383;es, and &#383;ilk hangings of a French apartment,
are only a gay di&#383;gui&#383;e; and a hou&#383;e, which to the
eye may be attractive even to &#383;plendour, often has not one
room that an Engli&#383;hman would find tolerably convenient. Every
thing intended for u&#383;e rather than &#383;hew is &#383;canty
and &#383;ordid&mdash;all is <i>beau, magnifique, gentil,</i> or
<i>&#383;uperb,</i> [Fine magnificent, genteel, or &#383;uperb.]
and nothing comfortable. The French have not the word, or its
&#383;ynonime, in their language.</p>
<p>In France, clothes are almo&#383;t as durable as furniture, and
the gaiety which twenty or thirty years ago we were
complai&#383;ant enough to admire i&#383; far from being
expen&#383;ive. People are not more than five or &#383;ix hours a
day in their gala habits, and the whole of this period is
judiciou&#383;ly cho&#383;en between the hours of repa&#383;t,
&#383;o that no ri&#383;k in incurred by accidents at table. Then
the caprices of fa&#383;hion, which in England are &#383;o various
and de&#383;potic, have here a more limited influence: the form of
a dre&#383;s changes as long as the material is convertible, and
when it ha&#383; outla&#383;ted the po&#383;&#383;ibility of
adaptation to a reigning mode, it is not on that account rejected,
but is generally worn in &#383;ome way or other till bani&#383;hed
by the more rational motive of its decay. All the expences of
tea-vi&#383;its, breakfa&#383;t-loungings, and chance-dinners, are
avoided&mdash;an evening vi&#383;it is pa&#383;&#383;ed entirely at
cards, a breakfa&#383;t in form even for the family is
unu&#383;ual, and there are very few hou&#383;es where you could
dine without being previou&#383;ly engaged. I am, indeed, certain,
that (unle&#383;s in large e&#383;tabli&#383;hments) the
calculation for diurnal &#383;upply is &#383;o exact, that the
intru&#383;ion of a &#383;tranger would be felt by the whole
family. I mu&#383;t, however, do them the ju&#383;tice to &#383;ay,
that on &#383;uch occa&#383;ions, and where they find the thing to
be inevitable, they put the be&#383;t face po&#383;&#383;ible on
it, and the gue&#383;t is entertained, if not plentifully, and with
a very &#383;incere welcome, at lea&#383;t with &#383;miles and
compliments. The French, indeed, allow, that they live le&#383;s
ho&#383;pitably than the Engli&#383;h: but then they &#383;ay they
are not &#383;o rich; and it is true, property is not &#383;o
general, nor &#383;o much diffu&#383;ed, as with us. This is,
however, only relative, and you will not &#383;u&#383;pect me of
being &#383;o uncandid as to make compari&#383;ons without allowing
for every difference which is the effect of nece&#383;&#383;ity.
All my remarks of this kind are made after an unprejudiced
compari&#383;on of the people of the &#383;ame rank or fortune in
the two countries;&mdash;yet even the mo&#383;t liberal examination
mu&#383;t end by concluding, that the oeconomy of the French too
nearly approaches to meanne&#383;s, and that their civility is
o&#383;tentatious, perhaps often either intere&#383;ted, or even
verbal.</p>
<p>You already exclaim, why, in the year 1793, you are
characterizing a nation in the &#383;tyle of Salmon! and implying a
panegyric on the moral of the School for Scandal! I plead to the
fir&#383;t part of the charge, and &#383;hall hereafter defend my
opinion again&#383;t the more poli&#383;hed writers who have
&#383;ucceeded Salmon. For the moral of the School for Scandal, I
have always con&#383;idered it as the &#383;eal of humanity on a
comedy which would otherwi&#383;e be perfection.</p>
<p>It is not the oeconomy of the French that I am cen&#383;uring,
but their vanity, which, engro&#383;&#383;ing all their means of
expence, prefers &#383;how to accommodation, and the parade of a
&#383;umptuous repa&#383;t three or four times a year to a plainer
but more frequent ho&#383;pitality.&mdash;I am far from being the
advocate of extravagance, or the enemy of dome&#383;tic order; and
the liberality which is circum&#383;cribed only by prudence
&#383;hall not find in me a cen&#383;urer.</p>
<p>My ideas on the French character and manner of living may not be
unu&#383;eful to &#383;uch of my countrymen as come to France with
the project of retrieving their affairs; for it is very
nece&#383;&#383;ary they &#383;hould be informed, that it is not
&#383;o much the difference in the price of things, which makes a
re&#383;idence here oeconomical, as a conformity to the habits of
the country; and if they were not deterred by a fal&#383;e
&#383;hame from a temporary adoption of the &#383;ame
&#383;y&#383;tem in England, their object might often be obtained
without leaving it. For this rea&#383;on it may be remarked, that
the Engli&#383;h who bring Engli&#383;h &#383;ervants, and
per&#383;i&#383;t in their Engli&#383;h mode of living, do not
often derive very &#383;olid advantages from their exile, and their
abode in France is rather a retreat from their creditors than the
mean&#383; of paying their debts.</p>
<p>Adieu.&mdash;You will not be &#383;orry that I have been able
for a moment to forget our per&#383;onal &#383;ufferings, and the
mi&#383;erable politics of the country. The details of the former
are not plea&#383;ant, and the latter grow every day more
inexplicable.</p>

<h2>January 6, 1794.</h2>
<p>If I had undertaken to follow the French revolution through all
it&#383; ab&#383;urdities and iniquities, my indolence would long
&#383;ince have taken the alarm, and I &#383;hould have
relinqui&#383;hed a ta&#383;k become too difficult and too
laborious. Events are now too numerous and too complicated to be
de&#383;cribed by occa&#383;ional remarks; and a narrator of no
more preten&#383;ion&#383; than my&#383;elf may be allowed to
&#383;hrink from an abundance of matter which will hereafter
perplex the choice and excite the wonder of the
hi&#383;torian.&mdash;Removed from the great &#383;cene of
intrigues, we are little acquainted with them&mdash;we begin to
&#383;uffer almo&#383;t before we begin to conjecture, and our
&#383;olicitude to examine cau&#383;es is lo&#383;t in the rapidity
with which we feel their effects.</p>
<p>Amid&#383;t the more mi&#383;chievous changes of a
philo&#383;ophic revolution, you will have learned from the
new&#383;papers, that the French have adopted a new aera and a new
calendar, the one dating from the foundation of their republic, and
other de&#383;criptive of the climate of Paris, and the productions
of the French territory. I doubt, however, if the&#383;e new
almanack-makers will create &#383;o much confu&#383;ion as might be
&#383;uppo&#383;ed, or as they may de&#383;ire, for I do not find
as yet that their &#383;y&#383;tem has made its way beyond the
public offices, and the country people are particularly refractory,
for they per&#383;i&#383;t in holding their fairs, markets, &amp;c.
as u&#383;ual, without any regard to the hallowed decade of their
legi&#383;lators. As it is to be pre&#383;umed that the French do
not wi&#383;h to relinqui&#383;h all commercial intercour&#383;e
with other nations, they mean po&#383;&#383;ibly to tack the
republican calendar to the rights of man, and &#383;end their
armies to propagate them together; otherwi&#383;e the
corre&#383;pondence of a Frenchman will be as difficult to
interpret with mercantile exactne&#383;s as the characters of the
Chine&#383;e.</p>
<p>The vanity of the&#383;e philo&#383;ophers would,
doubtle&#383;s, be gratified by forcing the re&#383;t of Europe and
the civilized world to adopt their u&#383;ele&#383;&#383; and
chimerical innovations, and they might think it a triumph to
&#383;ee the inhabitant of the Hebrides date <i>"Vendemiaire,"</i>
[Alluding to the vintage.] or the parched We&#383;t-Indian
<i>"Nivo&#383;e;"</i> but vanity is not on this, as it is on many
other occa&#383;ions, the leading principle.&mdash;It wa&#383;
hoped that a new arrangement of the year, and a different
nomenclature of the months, &#383;o as to bani&#383;h all the
commemorations of Chri&#383;tianity, might prepare the way for
aboli&#383;hing religion it&#383;elf, and, if it were
po&#383;&#383;ible to impo&#383;e the u&#383;e of the new calendar
&#383;o far as to exclude the old one, this might certainly
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t their more &#383;erious athei&#383;tical
operations; but as the &#383;ucce&#383;s of &#383;uch an
introduction might depend on the will of the people, and is not
within the competence of the bayonet, the old year will maintain
its ground, and the&#383;e pedantic triflers find that they have
laboured to no more exten&#383;ive a purpo&#383;e, than to
furni&#383;h a date to the new&#383;papers, or to their own
decrees, which no one will take the pains to under&#383;tand.</p>
<p>Mankind are in general more attached to cu&#383;toms than
principles. The u&#383;eful de&#383;poti&#383;m of Peter, which
&#383;ubdued &#383;o many of the prejudices of hi&#383; countrymen,
could not achieve the curtailment of their beards; and you
mu&#383;t not imagine that, with all the endurance of the French,
the&#383;e continual attempts at innovation pa&#383;s without
murmurs: partial revolt&#383; happen very frequently; but, as they
are the &#383;pontaneous effect of per&#383;onal &#383;uffering,
not of political manoeuvre, they are without concert or union, of
cour&#383;e ea&#383;ily quelled, and only &#383;erve to
&#383;trengthen the government.&mdash;The people of Amiens have
lately, in one of the&#383;e &#383;udden effu&#383;ions of
di&#383;content, burnt the tree of liberty, and even the
repre&#383;entative, Dumont, has been menaced; but the&#383;e are
only the blows of a coward who is alarmed at his own temerity, and
dreads the cha&#383;ti&#383;ement of it.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The whole town of Bedouin, in the &#383;outh of
France, was burnt pur&#383;uant to a decree of the convention, to
expiate the imprudence of &#383;ome of its inhabitants in having
cut down a dead tree of liberty. Above &#383;ixty people were
guillotined as accomplices, and their bodie&#383; thrown into pits,
dug by order of the repre&#383;entative, Magnet, (then on
mi&#383;&#383;ion,) before their death. The&#383;e executions were
&#383;ucceeded by a conflagration of all the hou&#383;es, and the
impri&#383;onment or di&#383;per&#383;ion of their
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ors. It is likewi&#383;e worthy of
remark, that many of the&#383;e la&#383;t were obliged, by
expre&#383;s order of Maignet, to be &#383;pectators of the murder
of their friends and relations.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This crime in the revolutionary code is of a very &#383;erious
nature; and however trifling it may appear to you, it depends only
on the will of Dumont to &#383;acrifice many lives on the
occa&#383;ion. But Dumont, though erected by circum&#383;tances
into a tyrant, is not &#383;anguinary&mdash;he is by nature and
education pa&#383;&#383;ionate and gro&#383;s, and in other times
might only have been a good natured Poli&#383;&#383;on. Hitherto he
has contented him&#383;elf with alarming, and making people tired
of their lives, but I do not believe he has been the direct or
intentional cau&#383;e of anyone's death. He has &#383;o often been
the hero of my adventures, that I mention him familiarly to you,
without reflecting, that though the delegate of more than
monarchical power here, he is too in&#383;ignificant of
him&#383;elf to be known in England. But the hi&#383;tory of Dumont
is that of two-thirds of the Convention. He was originally clerk to
an attorney at Abbeville, and afterwards &#383;et up for
him&#383;elf in a neighbouring village. His youth having been
marked by &#383;ome digre&#383;&#383;ions from the "'haviour of
reputation," his profe&#383;&#383;ion was far from affording him a
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence; and the revolution, which &#383;eems to
have called forth all that was turbulent, unprincipled, or
nece&#383;&#383;itous in the country, naturally found a partizan in
an attorney without practice.&mdash;At the election of 1792, when
the King's fall and the domination of the Jacobins had &#383;pread
&#383;o general a terror that no man of character could be
prevailed upon to be a candidate for a public &#383;ituation,
Dumont availed him&#383;elf of this timidity and
&#383;upinene&#383;s in tho&#383;e who ought to have become the
repre&#383;entatives of the people; and, by a talent for intrigue,
and a coar&#383;e facility of phra&#383;e-making, (for he has no
preten&#383;ions to eloquence,) prevailed on the mob to elect him.
His local knowledge, active di&#383;po&#383;ition, and
&#383;ub&#383;ervient indu&#383;try, render him an u&#383;eful kind
of drudge to any prevailing party, and, &#383;ince the overthrow of
the Bri&#383;&#383;otines, he ha&#383; been entru&#383;ted with the
government of this and &#383;ome of the neighbouring departments.
He profe&#383;&#383;es him&#383;elf a zealous republican, and an
apo&#383;tle of the doctrine of univer&#383;al equality, yet unites
in his per&#383;on all the attributes of de&#383;poti&#383;m, and
lives with more luxury and expence than mo&#383;t of the
<i>ci-devant</i> gentry. His former habitation at Oi&#383;emont is
not much better than a good barn; but patrioti&#383;m is more
profitable here than in England, and he has lately purcha&#383;ed a
large man&#383;ion belonging to an emigrant.</p>

&#383;poils:" and perhap&#383; it is matter of congratulation to a
country, when the profe&#383;&#383;ion of patrioti&#383;m is not
lucrative. Many agreeable inferences may be made from it&mdash;the

by a led hor&#383;e, and a party of dragoons. I fear &#383;ome of
your patriots behold this with envy, and it is not to be wondered
at that they &#383;hould wi&#383;h to &#383;ee a &#383;imilar

impri&#383;oning and guillotining all their countrymen! What
halcyon days, when the ari&#383;tocratic palace&#383;* &#383;hall
be purified by &#383;olacing the fatigue&#383; of republican
virtue, and the levellers of all di&#383;tinction travel with four
hor&#383;es and a military e&#383;cort!&mdash;But, as
Robe&#383;pierre ob&#383;erves, you are two centuries behind the
French in patrioti&#383;m and information; and I doubt if
Engli&#383;h republicani&#383;m will ever go beyond a dinner, and
toa&#383;ting the manes of Hampden and Sydney. I would, therefore,
&#383;eriou&#383;ly advi&#383;e any of my compatriots who may be
enamoured of a government founded on the rights of man, to quit an
ungrateful country which &#383;eems &#383;o little
di&#383;po&#383;ed to reward their labours, and enjoy the
&#383;upreme delight of men a &#383;y&#383;teme, that of
&#383;eeing their theories in action.</p>

<h2>January, 1794.</h2>
<p>The total &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion of all religious
wor&#383;hip in this country is an event of too &#383;ingular and
important a nature not to have been commented upon largely by the
Engli&#383;h papers; but, though I have little new to add on the
&#383;ubject, my own reflections have been too much occupied in
con&#383;equence for me to pa&#383;s it over in &#383;ilence.</p>
<p>I am yet in the fir&#383;t emotions of wonder: the va&#383;t
edifice which had been rai&#383;ed by the blended efforts of
religion and &#383;uper&#383;tition, which had been
con&#383;ecrated by time, endeared by national ta&#383;te, and
become nece&#383;&#383;ary by habit, has now di&#383;appeared, and
&#383;carcely left a ve&#383;tige of its ruins. To tho&#383;e who
revert only to the genius of the Catholic religion, and to former
periods of the hi&#383;tory of France, this event mu&#383;t
&#383;eem incredible; and nothing but con&#383;tant opportunities
of marking it&#383; gradual approach can reconcile it to
probability. The pious chri&#383;tian and the in&#383;idious
philo&#383;opher have equally contributed to the general effect,
though with very different intentions: the one, con&#383;ulting
only his rea&#383;on, wi&#383;hed to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a pure and
&#383;imple mode of wor&#383;hip, which, dive&#383;ted of the
allurements of &#383;plendid proce&#383;&#383;ions and
impo&#383;ing ceremonies, &#383;hould teach the people their duty,
without captivating their &#383;en&#383;es; the other, better
acquainted with French character, knew how little the&#383;e views
were compatible with it, and hoped, under the &#383;peciou&#383;
pretext of bani&#383;hing the too numerous ornaments of the
Catholic practice, to &#383;hake the foundations of
Chri&#383;tianity it&#383;elf. Thus united in their efforts, though
di&#383;&#383;imilar in their motives, all parties were eager at
the beginning of the revolution for a reform in the Church: the
wealth of the Clergy, the mona&#383;tic e&#383;tabli&#383;hments,
the &#383;upernumerary &#383;aints, were devoted and attacked
without pity, and without regret; and, in the zeal and hurry of
innovation, the deci&#383;ive mea&#383;ure, which reduced
eccle&#383;ia&#383;tics to &#383;mall pen&#383;ions dependent on
the &#383;tate, was carried, before tho&#383;e who really meant
well were aware of its con&#383;equences. The next &#383;tep was,
to make the receiving the&#383;e pen&#383;ions &#383;ubject to an
oath, which the &#383;elfi&#383;h philo&#383;opher, who can coldly
calculate on, and triumph in, the weakne&#383;s of human nature,
fore&#383;aw would be a brand of di&#383;cord, certain to
de&#383;troy the &#383;ole force which the Clergy yet
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed&mdash;their union, and the public
opinion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the&#383;e views were not di&#383;appointed:
conviction, intere&#383;t, or fear, prevailed on many to take the
oath; while doubt, worldly improvidence, or a &#383;crupulous
piety, deterred others. A &#383;chi&#383;m took place between the
jurors and nonjuror&#383;&mdash;the people became equally divided,
and adhered either to the one or the other, as their habits or
prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ions directed them. Neither party, as
it may be imagined, could &#383;ee them&#383;elves deprived of any
portion of the public e&#383;teem, without concern, perhaps without
rancour; and their mutual animo&#383;ity, far from gaining
pro&#383;elytes to either, contributed only to the immediate
degradation and future ruin of both. Tho&#383;e, however, who had
not taken the pre&#383;cribed oath, were in general more popular
than what were called the con&#383;titutionali&#383;ts, and the
influence they were &#383;uppo&#383;ed to exert in alienating the
minds of their followers from the new form of government,
&#383;upplied the republican party with a pretext for
propo&#383;ing their bani&#383;hment.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*The King's exertion of the power ve&#383;ted in him by
the con&#383;titution, by putting a temporary negative on this
decree, it is well known, was one of the pretexts for dethroning
him.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>At the King's depo&#383;ition this decree took place, and
&#383;uch of the nonjuring prie&#383;ts as were not
ma&#383;&#383;acred in the pri&#383;ons, or e&#383;caped the
&#383;earch, were to be embarked for Guiana. The wi&#383;er and
better part of tho&#383;e who&#383;e compliances entitled them to
remain, were, I believe, far from con&#383;idering this
per&#383;ecution of their opponents as a triumph&mdash;to
tho&#383;e who did, it was of &#383;hort duration. The Convention,
which had hitherto attempted to di&#383;gui&#383;e its hatred of
the profe&#383;&#383;ion by cen&#383;ure and abu&#383;e of a part
of its members, began now to ridicule the profe&#383;&#383;ion
it&#383;elf: &#383;ome repre&#383;ented it as
u&#383;ele&#383;&#383;&mdash;others as pernicious and
irreconcileable with political freedom; and a di&#383;cour&#383;e*
was printed, under the &#383;anction of the A&#383;&#383;embly, to
prove, that the only fea&#383;ible republic mu&#383;t be
&#383;upported by pure athei&#383;m.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Extracts from the Report of Anachar&#383;is Cloots,
member of the Committee of Public In&#383;truction, printed by
order of the National Convention: "Our <i>Sans-culotte&#383;</i>
want no other &#383;ermon but the rights of man, no other doctrine
but the con&#383;titutional precepts and practice, nor any other
church than where the &#383;ection or the club hold their meetings,
&amp;c. "The propagation of the rights of man ought to be
pre&#383;ented to the a&#383;toni&#383;hed world pure and without
&#383;tain. It is not by offering &#383;trange gods to our
neighbours that we &#383;hall operate their conver&#383;ion. We can
never rai&#383;e them from their abject &#383;tate by erecting one
altar in oppo&#383;ition to another. A trifling here&#383;y i&#383;
infinitely more revolting than having no religion at all. Nature,
like the &#383;un, diffu&#383;es her light without the
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of prie&#383;t&#383; and ve&#383;tals.
While we were con&#383;titutional heretics, we maintained an army
of an hundred thou&#383;and prie&#383;ts, who waged war equally
with the Pope and the di&#383;ciples of Calvin. We cru&#383;hed the
old prie&#383;thood by means of the new, and while we compelled
every &#383;ect to contribute to the payment of a pretended
national religion, we became at once the abhorrence of all the
Catholics and Prote&#383;tants in Europe. The repul&#383;ion of our
religious belief counteracted the attraction of our political
principles.&mdash;But truth is at length triumphant, and all the
ill-intentioned &#383;hall no more be able to detach our
neighbour&#383; from the dominion of the rights of man, under
pretext of a religiou&#383; dominion which no longer
exi&#383;ts.&mdash;The purpo&#383;e of religion is no how &#383;o
well an&#383;wered as by pre&#383;enting carte blanche to the
abu&#383;ed world. Every one will then be at liberty to form his
&#383;piritual regimen to his own ta&#383;te, till in the end the
invincible a&#383;cendant of rea&#383;on &#383;hall teach him that
the Supreme Being, the Eternal Being, is no other than Nature
uncreated and uncreatable; and that the only Providence is the
a&#383;&#383;ociation of mankind in freedom and equality!&mdash;
This &#383;overeign providence affords comfort to the afflicted,
reward&#383; the good, and puni&#383;hes the wicked. It
exerci&#383;es no unju&#383;t partialities, like the providence of
knaves and fools. Man, when free, wants no other divinity than
him&#383;elf. This god will not co&#383;t us a &#383;ingle
farthing, not a &#383;ingle tear, nor a drop of blood. From the
&#383;ummit of our mountain he hath promulgated his laws, traced in
evident characters on the tables of nature. From the Ea&#383;t to
the We&#383;t they will be under&#383;tood without the aid of
interpreters, comments, or miracles. Every other ritual will be
torn in pieces at the appearance of that of rea&#383;on.
Rea&#383;on dethrones both the King&#383; of the earth, and the
Kings of heaven.&mdash;No monarch above, if we wi&#383;h to
pre&#383;erve our republic below. "Volumes have been written to
determine whether or no a republic of Athei&#383;ts could
exi&#383;t. I maintain that every other republic is a chimera. If
you once admit the exi&#383;tence of a heavenly Sovereign, you
introduce the wooden hor&#383;e within your wall&#383;!&mdash;What
you adore by day will be your de&#383;truction at night. "A people
of thei&#383;ts nece&#383;&#383;arily become revelationi&#383;ts,
that is to &#383;ay, &#383;laves of prie&#383;ts, who are but
religious go-betweens, and phy&#383;icians of damned &#383;ouls.
"If I were a &#383;coundrel, I &#383;hould make a point of
exclaiming again&#383;t athei&#383;m, for a religious ma&#383;k is
very convenient to a traitor. "The intolerance of truth will one
day pro&#383;cribe the very name of temple 'fanum,' the etymology
of fanatici&#383;m. "We &#383;hall in&#383;tantly &#383;ee the
monarchy of heaven condemned in its turn by the revolutionary
tribunal of victorious Rea&#383;on; for Truth, exalted on the
throne of Nature, is &#383;overeignly intolerant. "The republic of
the rights of man is, properly &#383;peaking, neither
thei&#383;tical nor athei&#383;tical&mdash;it is
nihili&#383;tical."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the mo&#383;t eminent conforming Prelates and Clergy
were arre&#383;ted, and even individuals, who had the reputation of
being particularly devout, were marked as objects of
per&#383;ecution. A new calendar wa&#383; devi&#383;ed, which
excluded the ancient fe&#383;tivals, and limited public
wor&#383;hip to the decade, or tenth day, and all ob&#383;ervance
of the Sabbath wa&#383; interdicted. The pri&#383;ons were crouded
with &#383;ufferers in the cau&#383;e of religion, and all who had
not the zeal or the courage of martyrs, ab&#383;tained from
manife&#383;ting any attachment to the Chri&#383;tian faith.</p>
<p>While this con&#383;ternation was yet recent, the Deputies on
mi&#383;&#383;ion in the departments &#383;hut up the churches
entirely: the refu&#383;e of low clubs were paid and encouraged to
break the windows and de&#383;troy the monuments; and the&#383;e
outrages, which, it was previou&#383;ly concerted, &#383;hould at
fir&#383;t a&#383;&#383;ume the appearance of popular tumult, were
&#383;oon regulated and directed by the mandates of the Convention
them&#383;elves. The churches were again opened, an athei&#383;tic
ritual, and licentious homilies,* were &#383;ub&#383;tituted for
the pro&#383;cribed &#383;ervice&mdash;and an ab&#383;urd and
ludicrous imitation of the Greek mythology was exhibited, under the
title of the Religion of Rea&#383;on.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I have read a di&#383;cour&#383;e pronounced in a
church at Paris, on the decade, &#383;o indecent and profane, that
the mo&#383;t humble audience of a country-puppet &#383;how in
England would not have tolerated it.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On the principal church of every town was in&#383;cribed, "The
Temple of Rea&#383;on;" and a tutelary godde&#383;s was
in&#383;talled with a ceremony equally pedantic, ridiculous, and
profane.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* At Havre, the godde&#383;s of Rea&#383;on was drawn
on a car by four cart-hor&#383;es, and as it was judged
nece&#383;&#383;ary, to prevent accidents, that the hor&#383;es
&#383;hould be conducted by tho&#383;e they were accu&#383;tomed
to, the carters were likewi&#383;e put in requi&#383;ition and
furni&#383;hed with cuira&#383;&#383;es a l'antique from the
theatre. The men, it &#383;eems, being neither martial nor learned,
were not au fait at this equipment, and concluding it was only a
wai&#383;tcoat of ceremony, inve&#383;ted them&#383;elves with the
front behind, and the back part laced before, to the great
amu&#383;ement of the few who were &#383;en&#383;ible of the
mi&#383;take.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet the philo&#383;ophers did not on this occa&#383;ion
di&#383;dain tho&#383;e adventitiou&#383; aids, the u&#383;e of
which they had &#383;o much declaimed again&#383;t while they were
the auxiliaries of Chri&#383;tianity.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Mr. Gibbon reproaches the Chri&#383;tians with their
adoption of the allurements of the Greek mythology.&mdash;The
Catholics have been more ho&#383;tilely de&#383;poiled by their
modern per&#383;ecutors, and may retort that the religion of
rea&#383;on is a more gro&#383;s appeal to the &#383;en&#383;es
than the darke&#383;t ages of &#383;uper&#383;tition would have
ventured on.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Mu&#383;ic, proce&#383;&#383;ions, and decorations, which had
been bani&#383;hed from the ancient wor&#383;hip, were introduced
in the new one, and the philo&#383;ophical reformer, even in the
very attempt to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a religion purely
metaphy&#383;ical, found him&#383;elf obliged to inculcate it by a
gro&#383;s and material idolatry.*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The French do not yet annex any other idea to the
religion of rea&#383;on than that of the female who performs the
part of the godde&#383;s.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, by &#383;ubmitting his ab&#383;tractions to the genius of
the people, and the imperfections of our nature, perhaps the
be&#383;t apology was offered for the errors of that wor&#383;hip
which had been pro&#383;cribed, per&#383;ecuted, and ridiculed.</p>
<p>Previous to the tenth day, on which a celebration of this kind
was to take place, a Deputy arrived, accompanied by the female
godde&#383;s:* that is, (if the town it&#383;elf did not produce
one for the purpo&#383;e,) a Roman dre&#383;s of white &#383;atin
was hired from the theatre, with which &#383;he wa&#383;
inve&#383;ted&mdash;her head covered with a red cap, ornamented
with oak leave&#383;&mdash; one arm was reclined on a plough, the
other gra&#383;ped a &#383;pear&mdash;and her feet were
&#383;upported by a globe, and environed by mutilated emblems of
&#383;eodality. [It is not po&#383;&#383;ible to explain this
co&#383;tume as appropriate.]</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The females who per&#383;onated the new divinity were
u&#383;ually &#383;elected from among&#383;t tho&#383;e who "might
make &#383;ectaries of whom they bid but follow," but who were more
con&#383;picuous for beauty than any other cele&#383;tial
attribute.&mdash;The itinerant godde&#383;s of the principal
town&#383; in the department de la Somme was the mi&#383;tre&#383;s
of one Taillefer, a republican General, brother to the Deputy of
the &#383;ame name.&mdash;I know not, in this military government,
whether the General's &#383;ervices on the occa&#383;ion were
included in his other appointments. At Amiens, he not only provided
the deity, but commanded the detachment that &#383;ecured her a
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive adoration.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus equipped, the divinity and her appendages were borne on the
&#383;houlders of Jacobins "en bonnet rouge," and e&#383;corted by
the National Guard, Mayor, Judges, and all the con&#383;tituted
authorities, who, whether diverted or indignant, were obliged to
pre&#383;erve a re&#383;pectful gravity of exterior. When the whole
cavalcade arrived at the place appointed, the godde&#383;s was

&#383;he harangued the people, who, in return, proffered their
adoration, and &#383;ung the Carmagnole, and other republican hymns
of the &#383;ame kind. They then proceeded in the &#383;ame order
to the principal church, in the choir of which the &#383;ame
ceremonies were renewed: a prie&#383;t was procured to abjure his
faith and avow the whole of Chri&#383;tianity an impo&#383;ture;*
and the fe&#383;tival concluded with the burning of prayer-books,
&#383;aints, confe&#383;&#383;ionals, and every thing appropriated
to the u&#383;e of public wor&#383;hip.**&mdash;</p>

more &#383;ervice to mankind than when dedicated to an u&#383;e

&#383;oothes the bed of &#383;ickne&#383;s, and heals the wounds of
con&#383;cience. Yet I am no advocate for the profu&#383;e
decorations of Catholic churches; and if I &#383;eem to plead in

<h2>Providence, Jan. 29.</h2>
<p>We are now quite dome&#383;ticated here, though in a very
mi&#383;erable way, without fire, and with our
mattre&#383;&#383;es, on the boards; but we neverthele&#383;&#383;
adopt the &#383;pirit of the country, and a total ab&#383;ence of
comfort does not prevent us from amu&#383;ing our&#383;elves. My
friend knits, and draws land&#383;cape&#383; on the backs of cards;
and I have e&#383;tabli&#383;hed a corre&#383;pondence with an old
book&#383;eller, who &#383;ends me treati&#383;es of chemi&#383;try
and fortifications, in&#383;tead of poetry and memoirs. I
endeavoured at fir&#383;t to borrow books of our companions, but
this re&#383;ource was &#383;oon exhau&#383;ted, and the whole
pri&#383;on &#383;upplied little more than a novel of Florian's,
<i>Le Voyage du jeune Anarchar&#383;is,</i> and &#383;ome of the
philo&#383;ophical romances of Voltaire.&mdash;They &#383;ay it
ennuyes them to read; and I ob&#383;erve, that tho&#383;e who read
at all, take their books into the garden, and prefer the mo&#383;t
crowded walks. The&#383;e &#383;tudious per&#383;ons, who &#383;eem
to &#383;urpa&#383;s Crambe him&#383;elf in the faculty of
ab&#383;traction, &#383;mile and bow at every comma, without any
appearance of derangement from &#383;uch frequent
interruptions.</p>
<p>Time pa&#383;&#383;es &#383;orrowly, rather than &#383;lowly;
and my thoughts, without being amu&#383;ed, are employed. The
novelty of our &#383;ituation, the pa&#383;t, the future, all offer
&#383;o many &#383;ubjects of reflection, that my mind has more
occa&#383;ion for repo&#383;e than amu&#383;ement. My only external
re&#383;ource i&#383; conver&#383;ing with our
fellow-pri&#383;oners, and learning the cau&#383;es of their
detention. The&#383;e relations furni&#383;h me with a &#383;ort of
"ab&#383;tract of the times," and mark the character of the
government better than circum&#383;tances of more apparent
con&#383;equence; for what are battles, &#383;ieges, and political
machinations, but as they ultimately affect the happine&#383;&#383;
of &#383;ociety? And when I learn that the lives, the liberty, and
property of no cla&#383;s are &#383;ecure from violation, it is not
nece&#383;&#383;ary one &#383;hould be at Paris to form an opinion
of this period of the revolution, and of tho&#383;e who conduct
it.</p>
<p>The per&#383;ecution which has hitherto been chiefly directed
again&#383;t the Noble&#383;&#383;e, has now a little
&#383;ub&#383;ided, and &#383;eems turned again&#383;t religion and
commerce. People are daily arre&#383;ted for
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ting at private ma&#383;&#383;es, concealing
images, or even for being po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ors of
religious books. Merchants are &#383;ent here as monopolizers, and
retailers, under variou&#383; pretexts, in order to give the
committees an opportunity of pillaging their &#383;hops. It is not
uncommon to &#383;ee people of the town who are our guards one day,
become our fellow-pri&#383;oners the next; and a few week&#383;
&#383;ince, the &#383;on of an old gentleman who has been &#383;ome
time here, after being on guard the whole day, in&#383;tead of
being relieved at the u&#383;ual hour, was joined by his wife and
children, under the e&#383;cort of a couple of dragoons, who
delivered the whole family into the cu&#383;tody of our keeper; and
this appears to have happened without any other motive than his
having pre&#383;ented a petition to Dumont in behalf of his
father.</p>
<p>An old man was lately taken from his hou&#383;e in the night,
and brought here, becau&#383;e he was &#383;aid to have worn the
cro&#383;s of St. Louis.&mdash;The fact is, however, that he never
did wear this obnoxious di&#383;tinction; and though his daughter
has proved this incontrovertibly to Dumont, &#383;he cannot obtain
his liberty: and the poor young woman, after making two or three
fruitle&#383;s journeys to Paris, is obliged to content
her&#383;elf with &#383;eeing her father occa&#383;ionally at the
gate.</p>
<p>The refectory of the convent is inhabited by ho&#383;pital nuns.
Many of the ho&#383;pitals in France had a &#383;ort of religious
order annexed to them, who&#383;e bu&#383;ine&#383;s it was to
attend the &#383;ick; and habit, perhaps too the
a&#383;&#383;ociation of the offices of humanity with the duties of
religion, had made them &#383;o u&#383;eful in their
profe&#383;&#383;ion, that they were &#383;uffered to remain, even
after the abolition of the regular mona&#383;teries. But the
deva&#383;tating torrent of the revolution at length reached them:
they were accu&#383;ed of be&#383;towing a more tender
&#383;olicitude on their ari&#383;tocratic patients than on the
wounded volunteers and republicans; and, upon the&#383;e curious
charges, they have been heaped into carts, without a &#383;ingle
nece&#383;&#383;ary, almo&#383;t without covering, &#383;ent from
one department to another, and di&#383;tributed in different
pri&#383;ons, where they are peri&#383;hing with cold,
&#383;ickne&#383;s, and want! Some people are here only
becau&#383;e they happened to be accidentally at a hou&#383;e when
the owner was arre&#383;ted;* and we have one family who were taken
at dinner, with their gue&#383;ts, and the plate they were
u&#383;ing!</p>

<p>A grand-daughter of the celebrated De Witt, who re&#383;ided
thirty league&#383; from hence, was arre&#383;ted in the night, put
in an open cart, without any regard to her age, her &#383;ex, or
her infirmities, though the rain fell in torrents; and, after
&#383;leeping on &#383;traw in different pri&#383;ons on the road,
was depo&#383;ited here. As a Fleming, the law places her in the
&#383;ame predicament with a very pretty young woman who has lived
&#383;ome months at Amiens; but Dumont, who is at once the maker,
the interpreter, and executor of the laws, has exempted the latter
from the general pro&#383;cription, and appears daily with her in
public; whereas poor Madame De Witt is excluded from &#383;uch
indulgence, being above &#383;eventy years old&mdash; and is
accu&#383;ed, moreover, of having been mo&#383;t exemplarily
charitable, and, what is &#383;till wor&#383;e, very
religious.&mdash;I have given the&#383;e in&#383;tance&#383; not as
any way remarkable, and only that you may form &#383;ome idea of
the pretexts which have &#383;erved to cover France with
pri&#383;ons, and to conduct &#383;o many of its inhabitants to the
&#383;caffold.</p>
<p>It is impo&#383;&#383;ible to reflect on a country in &#383;uch
a &#383;ituation, without abhorring the authors of it, and dreading
the propagation of their doctrines. I hope they neither have
imitators nor admirers in England; yet the convention in their
debates, the Jacobins, and all the French new&#383;papers,
&#383;eem &#383;o &#383;anguine in their expectation, and &#383;o
po&#383;itive in their a&#383;&#383;ertions of an Engli&#383;h
revolution, that I occa&#383;ionally, and in &#383;pite of
my&#383;elf, feel a vague but &#383;erious &#383;olicitude, which I
&#383;hould not have &#383;uppo&#383;ed the apprehen&#383;ion of
any political evil could in&#383;pre. I know the good
&#383;en&#383;e and information of my countrymen offer a powerful
re&#383;ource again&#383;t the love of change and metaphy&#383;ical
&#383;ubtilties; but, it is certain, the French government have
much depended on the &#383;pirit of party, and the zeal of their
propagandi&#383;tes. They talk of a Briti&#383;h convention, of a
conventional army, and, in &#383;hort, all France &#383;eem
prepared to &#383;ee their neighbours involved in the &#383;ame
di&#383;a&#383;trous &#383;y&#383;tem with them&#383;elves. The
people are not a little &#383;upported in this error by the
extracts that are given them from your orators in the Hou&#383;e of
Commons, which teem with nothing but complaints again&#383;t the
oppre&#383;&#383;ion of their own country, and
enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic admiration of French liberty. We read and
wonder&mdash;collate the Bill of Rights with the Code
Revolutionnaire, and again fear what we cannot give credit to.</p>
<p>Since the reports I allude to have gained ground, I have been
forcibly &#383;tricken by a difference in the character of the two
nations. At the pro&#383;pect of a revolution, all the French who
could conveniently leave the country, fled; and tho&#383;e that
remained (except adventurers and the banditti that were their
accomplices) &#383;tudiou&#383;ly avoided taking any part. But
&#383;o little are our countrymen affected with this
&#383;elfi&#383;h apathy, that I am told there is &#383;carcely one
here who, amid&#383;t all his pre&#383;ent &#383;ufferings, does
not &#383;eem to regret his ab&#383;ence from England, more on
account of not being able to oppo&#383;e this threatened attack on
our con&#383;titution, than for any per&#383;onal motive.&mdash;The
example before them mu&#383;t, doubtle&#383;s, tend to
increa&#383;e this &#383;entiment of genuine patrioti&#383;m; for
whoever came to France with but a &#383;ingle grain of it in
hi&#383; compo&#383;ition, mu&#383;t return with more than enough
to con&#383;titute an hundred patriots, who&#383;e hatred of
de&#383;poti&#383;m is only a principle, and who have never felt
its effects.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h2>February 2, 1794.</h2>
<p>The factions which have cho&#383;en to give France the
appellation of a republic, &#383;eem to have judged, and with
&#383;ome rea&#383;on, that though it might an&#383;wer their
purpo&#383;e to amu&#383;e the people with &#383;pecious theories
of freedom, their habits and ideas were far from requiring that
the&#383;e fine &#383;chemes &#383;hould be carried into practice.
I know of no example equal to the &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion of the
French at this moment; and if "departed &#383;pirit&#383; were
permitted to review the world," the &#383;hades of Richelieu or
Louvoi&#383; might hover with envy round the Committee of Public
Welfare, and regret the undaring moderation of their own
politics.</p>
<p>How &#383;hall I explain to an Engli&#383;hman the doctrine of
univer&#383;al requi&#383;ition? I rejoice that you can imagine
nothing like it.&mdash;After e&#383;tabli&#383;hing, as a general
principle, that the whole country is at the di&#383;po&#383;al of
government, &#383;ucceeding decrees have made &#383;pecific claims
on almo&#383;t every body, and every thing. The tailors,
&#383;hoemakers,* bakers, &#383;miths, &#383;adlers, and many other
trades, are all in requi&#383;ition&mdash;carts, hor&#383;es, and
carriages of every kind, are in requi&#383;ition&mdash;the
&#383;tables and cellars are put in requi&#383;ition for the
extraction of &#383;altpetre, and the hou&#383;es to lodge
&#383;oldiers, or to be converted into pri&#383;ons.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* In order to prevent frauds, the &#383;hoemakers were
obliged to make only &#383;quare-toed &#383;hoes, and every
per&#383;on not in the army wa&#383; forbidden to wear them of this
form. Indeed, people of any pretentions to patrioti&#383;m (that is
to &#383;ay, who were much afraid) did not venture to wear any
thing but wooden &#383;hoes; as it had been declared anti-civique,
if not &#383;u&#383;picious, to walk in leather.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Sometimes &#383;hopkeepers are forbidden to &#383;ell
their cloth, nails, wine, bread, meat, &amp;c. There are
in&#383;tances where whole towns have been kept without the
nece&#383;&#383;aries of life for &#383;everal days together, in
con&#383;equence of the&#383;e interdictions; and I have known it
proclaimed by beat of drum, that whoever
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed two uniforms, two hats, or two pair
of &#383;hoes, &#383;hould relinqui&#383;h one for the u&#383;e of
the army! Yet with all the&#383;e efforts of de&#383;poti&#383;m,
the republican troops are in many re&#383;pects ill &#383;upplied,
the produce being too often converted to the u&#383;e of the
agent&#383; of government, who are all Jacobins, and who&#383;e
peculations are &#383;uffered with impunity, becau&#383;e they are
too nece&#383;&#383;ary, or perhaps too formidable for
puni&#383;hment.</p>
<p>The&#383;e proceedings, which are not the le&#383;s
mi&#383;chievous for being ab&#383;urd, mu&#383;t end in a total
de&#383;truction of commerce: the merchant will not import what he
may be obliged to &#383;ell exclu&#383;ively to government at an
arbitrary and inadequate valuation.&mdash;Tho&#383;e who are not
impri&#383;oned, and have it in their power, are for the mo&#383;t
part retired from bu&#383;ine&#383;s, or at lea&#383;t avoid all
foreign &#383;peculations; &#383;o that France may in a few months
depend only on her internal re&#383;ources. The &#383;ame
mea&#383;ures which ruin one cla&#383;s, &#383;erve as a pretext to
oppre&#383;s and levy contributions on the re&#383;t.&mdash;In
order to make this right of &#383;eizure &#383;till more
productive, almo&#383;t every village has its &#383;pies, and the
domiciliary vi&#383;its are become &#383;o frequent, that a man is
le&#383;s &#383;ecure in his own hou&#383;e, than in a de&#383;ert
amid&#383;t Arabs. On the&#383;e occa&#383;ions, a band of
Jacobins, with a municipal officer at their head, enter &#383;ans
ceremonie, over-run your apartments, and if they find a few pounds
of &#383;ugar, &#383;oap, or any other article which they
choo&#383;e to judge more than &#383;ufficient for immediate
con&#383;umption, they take po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of the
whole as a monopoly, which they claim for the u&#383;e of the
republic, and the terrified owner, far from expo&#383;tulating,
think&#383; him&#383;elf happy if he e&#383;capes &#383;o
well.&mdash;But this is mere vulgar tyranny: a le&#383;s powerful
de&#383;poti&#383;m might invade the &#383;ecurity of &#383;ocial
life, and bani&#383;h its comforts. We are prone to &#383;uffer,
and it requires often little more than the will to do evil to give
us a command over the happine&#383;s of others. The Convention are
more original, and, not &#383;ati&#383;fied with having reduced the
people to the mo&#383;t abject &#383;lavery, they exact a
&#383;emblance of content, and dictate at &#383;tated periods the
cha&#383;ti&#383;ement which awaits tho&#383;e who refu&#383;e to
&#383;mile.</p>
<p>The &#383;plendid ceremonies at Paris, which pa&#383;s for
popular rejoicings, merit that appellation le&#383;s than an auto
de fe. Every movement i&#383; previou&#383;ly regulated by a
Commi&#383;&#383;ioner appointed for the purpo&#383;e, (to whom en
pa&#383;&#383;ant the&#383;e fetes are very lucrative jobs,) a plan
of the whole is di&#383;tributed, in which is pre&#383;cribed with
great exactne&#383;s, that at &#383;uch and &#383;uch parts the
people are to "melt into tears," at other&#383; they are to be
&#383;eized with a holy enthu&#383;ia&#383;m, and at the
conclu&#383;ion of the whole they are to rend the air with the cry
of "Vive la Convention!" &mdash;The&#383;e celebrations are always
attended by a military force, &#383;ufficient to en&#383;ure their
ob&#383;ervance, be&#383;ides a plentiful mixture of &#383;pies to
notice refractory countenances or faint acclamations.</p>
<p>The departments which cannot imitate the magnificence of Paris,
are obliged, neverthele&#383;s, to manife&#383;t their
&#383;ati&#383;faction. At every occa&#383;ion on which a rejoicing
is ordered, the &#383;ame kind of di&#383;cipline i&#383;
pre&#383;erved; and the ari&#383;tocrats, who&#383;e fears in
general overcome their principles, are often not the lea&#383;t
zealous attendants.</p>
<p>At the retaking of Toulon, when abandoned by our countrymen, the
National Guards were every where a&#383;&#383;embled to participate
in the fe&#383;tivity, under a menace of three days
impri&#383;onment. Tho&#383;e per&#383;ons who did not illuminate
their hou&#383;es were to be con&#383;idered as
&#383;u&#383;picious, and treated as &#383;uch: yet, even with all
the&#383;e precautions, I am informed the bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383;
was univer&#383;ally cold, and the balls thinly attended, except by
ari&#383;tocrats and relations of emigrants, who, in &#383;ome
places, with a ba&#383;ene&#383;s not excu&#383;ed even by their
terrors, exhibited them&#383;elves as a public &#383;pectacle, and
&#383;ang the defeats of that country which was armed in their
defence.</p>
<p>I mu&#383;t here remark to you a circum&#383;tance which does
&#383;till le&#383;s honour to the French character; and which you
will be unwilling to believe. In &#383;everal towns the officers
and others, under who&#383;e care the Engli&#383;h were placed
during their confinement, were de&#383;irous &#383;ometimes on
account of the peculiar hard&#383;hip of their &#383;ituation as
foreigners, to grant them little indulgences, and even more liberty
than to the French pri&#383;oners; and in this they were
ju&#383;tified on &#383;everal con&#383;iderations, as well a&#383;
that of humanity.&mdash;They knew an Engli&#383;hman could not
e&#383;cape, whatever facility might be given him, without being
immediately retaken; and that if his impri&#383;onment were made
&#383;evere, he had fewer external re&#383;ources and alleviations
than the natives of the country: but the&#383;e favourable
di&#383;po&#383;itions were of no avail&mdash;for whenever any of
our countrymen obtained an accommodation, the jealou&#383;y of the
French took umbrage, and they were obliged to relinqui&#383;h it,
or hazard the drawing embarra&#383;&#383;ment on the individual who
had &#383;erved them.</p>
<p>You are to notice, that the people in general, far from being
aver&#383;e to &#383;eeing the Engli&#383;h treated with a
comparative indulgence, were even plea&#383;ed at it; and the
invidious compari&#383;ons and complaints which prevented it,
proceeded from the gentry, from the families of tho&#383;e who had
found refuge in England, and who were involved in the common
per&#383;ecution.&mdash;I have, more than once, been reproached by
a female ari&#383;tocrat with the ill &#383;ucce&#383;s of the
Engli&#383;h army; and many, with whom I formerly lived on terms of
intimacy, would refu&#383;e me now the mo&#383;t trifling
&#383;ervice.&mdash;I have heard of a lady, who&#383;e hu&#383;band
and brother are both in London, who amu&#383;es her&#383;elf in
teaching a bird to repeat abu&#383;e of the Engli&#383;h.</p>
<p>It has been &#383;aid, that the day a man becomes a &#383;lave,
he lo&#383;es half hi&#383; virtue; and if this be true as to
per&#383;onal &#383;lavery, judging from the examples before me, I
conclude it equally &#383;o of political bondage.&mdash;The extreme
de&#383;poti&#383;m of the government &#383;eems to have confounded
every principle of right and wrong, every di&#383;tinction of
honour and di&#383;honour and the individual, of whatever
cla&#383;s, alive only to the &#383;en&#383;e of per&#383;onal
danger, embraces without reluctance meanne&#383;s or di&#383;grace,
if it in&#383;ure his &#383;afety.&mdash;A tailor or
&#383;hoemaker, who&#383;e reputation perhaps i&#383; too bad to
gain him a livelihood by any trade but that of a patriot,
&#383;hall be be&#383;ieged by the flatteries of people of rank,
and have levees a&#383; numerous as Choi&#383;eul or Calonne in
their meridian of power.</p>
<p>When a Deputy of the Convention is &#383;ent to a town on
mi&#383;&#383;ion, &#383;adne&#383;&#383; takes
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of every heart, and gaiety of every
countenance. He i&#383; be&#383;et with adulatory petitions, and
propitiating gifts; the Noble&#383;&#383;e who have e&#383;caped
confinement form a &#383;ort of court about his per&#383;on; and
thrice happy is the owner of that habitation at which he
conde&#383;cends to re&#383;ide.&mdash;*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* When a Deputy arrives, the gentry of the town contend
with jealou&#383; rival&#383;hip for the honour of lodging him; and
the mo&#383;t eloquent eulogi&#383;t of republican &#383;implicity
in the Convention does not fail to prefer a large hou&#383;e and a
good table, even though the unhallowed property of an
ari&#383;tocrat.&mdash;It is to be ob&#383;erved, that the&#383;e
Mi&#383;&#383;ionaries travel in a very patriarchal &#383;tyle,
accompanied by their wives, children, and a numerous train of
followers, who are not delicate in availing them&#383;elves of this
ho&#383;pitality, and are &#383;ometimes accu&#383;ed of carrying
off the linen, or any thing el&#383;e portable&mdash;even the
mo&#383;t decent behave on the&#383;e occa&#383;ions as though they
were at an inn.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;A Repre&#383;entative of gallantry has no rea&#383;on to

woman that plea&#383;es him; and, it is &#383;uppo&#383;ed, that
many a fair captive has owed her liberty to her charms, and that
the philo&#383;ophy of a French hu&#383;band has &#383;ometimes
opened the doors of hi&#383; pri&#383;on.</p>
<p>Dumont, who is married, and has be&#383;ides the countenance of
a white Negro, never vi&#383;its us without occa&#383;ioning a
general commotion among&#383;t all the females, e&#383;pecially
tho&#383;e who are young and pretty. As &#383;oon as it i&#383;
known that he is expected, the toilettes are all in activity, a
renovation of rouge and an adju&#383;tment of curls take place,
and, though performed with more ha&#383;te, not with le&#383;s
&#383;olicitude, than the preparatory &#383;plendour of a
fir&#383;t introduction.&mdash;When the great man arrives, he
find&#383; the court by which he enters crowded by the&#383;e
formidable pri&#383;oners, and each with a petition in her hand
endeavours, with the in&#383;idious coquetry of plaintive
&#383;miles and judicious tears, that brighten the eye without
deranging the features, to attract his notice and conciliate his
favour. Happy tho&#383;e who obtain a promi&#383;e, a look of
complacence, or even of curio&#383;ity!&mdash;But the attention of
this apo&#383;tle of republicani&#383;m is not often be&#383;towed,
except on high rank, or beauty; and a woman who is old, or ill
dre&#383;&#383;ed, that ventures to approach him, is u&#383;ually
repul&#383;ed with vulgar brutality&mdash;while the very &#383;ight
of a male &#383;uppliant renders him furious. The fir&#383;t half
hour he walks about, &#383;urrounded by his fair cortege, and is
tolerably civil; but at length, fatigued, I &#383;uppo&#383;e by
continual importunity, he lo&#383;es his temper, departs, and
throws all the petitions he has received unopened into the
fire.</p>
<p>Adieu&mdash;the &#383;ubject is too humiliating to dwell on. I
feel for my&#383;elf, I feel for human nature, when I &#383;ee the
fa&#383;tidiou&#383;ne&#383;s of wealth, the more liberal pride of
birth, and the yet more allowable preten&#383;ions of beauty,
degraded into the mo&#383;t abject &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to
&#383;uch a being as Dumont. Are our principles every where the
mere children of circum&#383;tance, or is it in this country only
that nothing is &#383;table? For my own part I love inflexibility
of character; and pride, even when ill founded, &#383;eems more
re&#383;pectable while it &#383;u&#383;tains it&#383;elf, than
conce&#383;&#383;ions which, refu&#383;ed to the
&#383;ugge&#383;tions of rea&#383;on, are yielded to the dictates
of fear.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>February 12, 1794.</h2>
<p>I was too much occupied by my per&#383;onal
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es to make any remarks on the revolutionary
government at the time of its adoption. The text of this political
phoenomenon mu&#383;t be well known in England&mdash;I &#383;hall,
therefore, confine my&#383;elf to giving you a general idea of its
&#383;pirit and tendency,&mdash;It is, compared to regular
government, what force is to mechani&#383;m, or the u&#383;ual and
peaceful operations of nature to the ravage&#383; of a
&#383;torm&mdash;it &#383;ub&#383;titutes violence for
conciliation, and &#383;weeps with precipitate fury all that
oppo&#383;es its deva&#383;tating progre&#383;s. It refer&#383;
every thing to a &#383;ingle principle, which is in it&#383;elf not
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of definition, and, like all undefined power,
is continually vibrating between de&#383;poti&#383;m and anarchy.
It is the execrable &#383;hape of Milton'&#383; Death, "which
&#383;hape hath none," and which can be de&#383;cribed only by
it&#383; effects.&mdash;For in&#383;tance, the revolutionary
tribunal condemns without evidence, the revolutionary committees
impri&#383;on without a charge, and whatever a&#383;&#383;umes the
title of revolutionary is exonerated from all &#383;ubjection to
humanity, decency, rea&#383;on, or ju&#383;tice.&mdash;Drowning the
in&#383;urgents, their wives and children, by boatloads, is called,
in the di&#383;patch to the Convention, a revolutionary
mea&#383;ure&mdash;*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The detail of the horrors committed in La Vendee and
at Nante&#383; were not at this time fully known. Carrier had,
however, acknowledged, in a report read to the Convention, that a
boat-load of refractory prie&#383;ts had been drowned, and children
of twelve year&#383; old condemned by a military
commi&#383;&#383;ion! One Fabre Marat, a republican General, wrote,
about the &#383;ame period, I think from Angers, that the
Guillotine was too &#383;low, and powder &#383;carce, &#383;o that
it was concluded more expedient to drown the rebels, which he
call&#383; a patriotic bapti&#383;m!&mdash;The following is a copy
of a letter addre&#383;&#383;ed to the Mayor of Paris by a
Commi&#383;&#383;ary of the Government:</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"You will give us plea&#383;ure by tran&#383;mitting the details
of your fete at Paris la&#383;t decade, with the hymns that were
&#383;ung. Here we all cried <i>"Vive la Republique!"</i> as we
ever do, when our holy mother Guillotine i&#383; at work. Within
the&#383;e three days &#383;he has &#383;haved eleven prie&#383;ts,
one <i>ci-devant</i> noble, a nun, a general, and a &#383;uperb
Engli&#383;hman, &#383;ix feet high, and as he was too tall by a
head, we have put that into the &#383;ack! At the &#383;ame time
eight hundred rebels were &#383;hot at the Pont du Ce, and their
carca&#383;es thrown into the Loire!&mdash;I under&#383;tand the
army is on the track of the runaways. All we overtake we &#383;hoot
on the &#383;pot, and in &#383;uch number&#383; that the ways are
heaped with them!"</p>
<p>&mdash;At Lyons, it is revolutionary to chain three hundred
victims together before the mouths of loaded cannon, and
ma&#383;&#383;acre tho&#383;e who e&#383;cape the di&#383;charge
with clubs and bayonets;* and at Paris, revolutionary jurie&#383;
guillotine all who come before them.&mdash;**</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The Convention formally voted their approbation of
this mea&#383;ure, and Collot d'Herbois, in a report on the
&#383;ubject, makes a kind of apo&#383;trophical panegyric on the
humanity of his colleagues. "Which of you, Citizens, (&#383;ays
he,) would not have fired the cannon? Which of you would not
joyfully have de&#383;troyed all the&#383;e traitors at a blow?" **
About this time a woman who &#383;old new&#383;papers, and the
printer of them, were guillotined for paragraphs deemed
incivique.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Yet this government is not more terrible than it is
minutely vexations. One's property is as little &#383;ecure as
one's exi&#383;tence. Revolutionary committees every where
&#383;eque&#383;trate in the gro&#383;s, in order to plunder in
detail.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The revolutionary committees, when they arre&#383;ted
any one, pretended to affix &#383;eals in form. The &#383;eal was
often, however, no other than the private one of &#383;ome
individual employed&mdash;&#383;ometime&#383; only a button or a
halfpenny, which was broken as often as the Committee wanted
acce&#383;s to the wine or other effects. Camille De&#383;moulins,
in an addre&#383;s to Freron, his fellow-deputy,

bien qu'ils traitent de matieres feodales, ils &#383;ont main
ba&#383;&#383;e &#383;ur la moitie de la bibliotheque, et chargent
deux Chrocheteurs de&#383; livres paternels. Ils trouvent une
pendule, don't la pointe de Paiguille etoit, comme la plupart des
pointes d'aiguilles, terminee en trefle: il leur &#383;emble que

po&#383;&#383;ibles, commencoit par ce protocole; Louis, &amp;c.
Ciel! &#383;'ecrient les Commi&#383;&#383;aires, le nom du

&#383;uffoquee d'abord par l'indignation, il&#383; mettent en poche
le brevet de pen&#383;ion, c'e&#383;t a dire 1000 livres de rente,

Freroa&mdash;que, decretes tous deux de pri&#383;e de corps, apres
le ma&#383;&#383;acre du Champ de Mars, nous trouvions un
a&#383;yle que le tyran n'o&#383;oit violer."</i></p>
<p>"The day before ye&#383;terday, two Commi&#383;&#383;aries
belonging to the &#383;ection of Mutius Scaevola, entered my
father-in-law's apartments; they found &#383;ome law-books in the
library, and, notwith&#383;tanding the decree which exempt&#383;
from &#383;eizure the works of Domat and Charles Dumouin, (although
they treat of feudal matters,) they proceeded to lay violent hands
on one half of the collection, and loaded two porters with paternal
&#383;poils. The next object that attracted their attention was a
clock, the hand of which, like the hands of mo&#383;t other clocks,
terminated in a point, in the form of a trefoil, which &#383;eemed
to them to bear &#383;ome re&#383;emblance to a fleur de lys; and,
notwith&#383;tanding the decree which ordains that the monuments of
the arts &#383;hall be re&#383;pected, they immediately
pa&#383;&#383;ed &#383;entence of confi&#383;cation on the clock. I
&#383;hould ob&#383;erve to you, that hard by lay a portmanteau,
having on it the maker's addre&#383;s, encircled with
lilies.&mdash; Here there was no di&#383;puting the fact, but as
the trunk was not worth five livres, the Commi&#383;&#383;aries
contented them&#383;elves with era&#383;ing the lilies; but the
unfortunate clock, being worth twelve hundred, was,
notwith&#383;tanding its trefoil, carried off by them&#383;elves,
for they would not tru&#383;t the porters with &#383;o precious a
load.&mdash;And all this was done in virtue of the law, which
Barrere aptly denominated the law of prehen&#383;ion, and which,
according to the terms of the decree it&#383;elf, was not
applicable to the ca&#383;e in que&#383;tion.</p>
<p>"At length our &#383;ectionary decemvirs, who thus placed
them&#383;elves above the law, di&#383;covered the grant of my
father-in-law's pen&#383;ion, which, like all &#383;imilar grants,
being excluded from the privilege of in&#383;cription on the great
regi&#383;ter of public debts, had been left in his port-folio; and
which began, as all &#383;uch grants nece&#383;&#383;arily
mu&#383;t, with the words, Louis, &amp;c. "Heaven!" exclaimed the
Commi&#383;&#383;aries, "here is the very name of the tyrant!" And,
as &#383;oon as they recovered their breaths, which had been nearly
&#383;topped by the violence of the indignation, they coolly
pocketed the grant, that is to &#383;ay, an annuity of one
thou&#383;and livres, and &#383;ent off the porridge-pot. Nor did
the&#383;e con&#383;titute all the crimes of Citizen
Duple&#383;&#383;is, who, having &#383;erved as fir&#383;t clerk of
the revenue board under Clugny, had, as was u&#383;ual, kept the
official &#383;eal of that day. An old port-folio, which had been
thrown a&#383;ide, and long forgotten, under a wardrobe, where it
was buried in du&#383;t, and had, in all probability, not been
touched for ten years, but, which with much difficulty, wa&#383;
di&#383;covered to bear the impre&#383;&#383;ion of a fleur de lys,
completed the proof that Citizen Duple&#383;&#383;is was a
&#383;u&#383;picious character. And now behold him &#383;hut up in
a pri&#383;on until peace &#383;hall be concluded, and the
&#383;eals put upon all the doors of that country &#383;eat, where,
you may remember, my dear Freron, that at the time when warrants
were i&#383;&#383;ued for apprehending u&#383; both, after the
ma&#383;&#383;acre in the Champ de Mars, we found an a&#383;ylum
which the tyrant did not dare to violate."</p>
<p>&mdash;In a word, you mu&#383;t generally under&#383;tand, that
the revolutionary &#383;y&#383;tem &#383;uper&#383;edes law,
religion, and morality; and that it inve&#383;ts the Committees of
Public Welfare and General Safety, their agents, the Jacobin clubs,
and &#383;ub&#383;idiary banditti, with the di&#383;po&#383;al of
the whole country and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>This gloomy aera of the revolution has its frivolities as well
as the le&#383;s di&#383;a&#383;trous periods, and the
barbari&#383;m of the moment is rendered additionally
di&#383;gu&#383;ting by a mixture of levity and pedantry.&mdash;It
is a fa&#383;hion for people at pre&#383;ent to abandon their
bapti&#383;mal and family names, and to a&#383;&#383;ume that of
&#383;ome Greek or Roman, which the debates of the Convention have
made familiar.&mdash;France &#383;warms with Gracchu&#383;'s and
Publicolas, who by imaginary a&#383;&#383;imilations of acts, which
a change of manners has rendered different, fancy them&#383;elves
more than equal to their prototypes.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The vici&#383;&#383;itudes of the revolution, and the
vengeance of party, have brought half the &#383;ages of Greece, and
patriots of Rome, to the Guillotine or the pillory. The Newgate
Calendar of Paris contain&#383; as many illu&#383;trious names as
the index to Plutarch's Lives; and I believe there are now many
Brutu&#383;'s and Gracchu&#383;'s in durance vile, be&#383;ides a
Mutius Scaevola condemned to twenty years impri&#383;onment for an
un&#383;kilful theft.&mdash;A man of Amiens, who&#383;e name is Le
Roy, &#383;ignified to the public, through the channel of a
new&#383;paper, that he had adopted that of Republic.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;A man who &#383;olicits to be the executioner of his own
brother yclep&#383; him&#383;elf Brutus, and a zealous preacher of
the right of univer&#383;al pillage cites the Agrarian law, and
&#383;igns him&#383;elf Lycurgus. Some of the Deputie&#383; have
di&#383;covered, that the French mode of dre&#383;&#383;ing is not
characteri&#383;tic of republicani&#383;m, and a project is now in
agitation to drill the whole country into the u&#383;e of a Roman
co&#383;tume.&mdash;You may perhaps &#383;u&#383;pect, that the
Romans had at lea&#383;t more bodily &#383;edatene&#383;s than
their imitators, and that the &#383;hrugs, jerks, and carracoles of
a French petit maitre, however republicanized, will not
a&#383;&#383;ort with the grave drapery of the toga. But on your
&#383;ide of the water you have a habit of rea&#383;oning and
deliberating &mdash;here they have that of talking and obeying.</p>
<p>Our whole community are in de&#383;pair to-day. Dumont has been
here, and tho&#383;e who acco&#383;ted him, as well as tho&#383;e
who only ventured to interpret his looks, all agree in their
reports that he is in a "bad humour."&mdash;The brighte&#383;t eyes
in France have &#383;upplicated in vain&mdash;not one grace of any
&#383;ort has been accorded&mdash;and we begin to cheri&#383;h even
our pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation, in the apprehen&#383;ion that it
may become wor&#383;e.&mdash;Ala&#383;! you know not of what evil
portent is the "bad humour" of a Repre&#383;entant. We are half of
us now, like the Per&#383;ian Lord, feeling if our heads are
&#383;till on our &#383;houlders.&mdash;I could add much to the
conclu&#383;ion of one of my la&#383;t letters. Surely this
ince&#383;&#383;ant &#383;olicitude for mere exi&#383;tence
debilitate&#383; the mind, and impairs even its pa&#383;&#383;ive
faculty of &#383;uffering. We intrigue for the favour of the
keeper, &#383;mile complacently at the gro&#383;&#383;
plea&#383;antries of a Jacobin, and tremble at the frown of a
Dumont.&mdash;I am a&#383;hamed to be the chronicler of &#383;uch
humiliation: but, "tu&#383;h, Hal; men, mortal men!" I can add no
better apology, and quit you to moralize on it.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>[No date given.]</h2>
<p>Were I a mere &#383;pectator, without fear for my&#383;elf or
compa&#383;&#383;ion for others, the &#383;ituation of this country
would be &#383;ufficiently amu&#383;ing. The effects produced (many
perhaps unavoidably) by a &#383;tate of revolution&mdash;the
&#383;trange remedies devi&#383;ed to obviate them&mdash;the
alternate neglect and &#383;everity with which the laws are
executed&mdash;the mixture of want and profu&#383;ion that
di&#383;tingui&#383;h the lower cla&#383;&#383;es of
people&mdash;and the di&#383;tre&#383;&#383; and humiliation of the
higher; all offer &#383;cenes &#383;o new and unaccountable, as not
to be imagined by a per&#383;on who has lived only under a regular
government, where the limits of authority are defined, the
nece&#383;&#383;aries of life plentiful, and the people rational
and &#383;ubordinate. The con&#383;equences of a general
&#383;pirit of monopoly, which I formerly de&#383;cribed, have
lately been &#383;o oppre&#383;&#383;ive, that the Convention
thought it nece&#383;&#383;ary to interfere, and in &#383;o
extraordinary a way, that I doubt if (as u&#383;ual) "the
di&#383;temper of their remedie&#383;" will not make us regret the
original di&#383;ea&#383;e. Almo&#383;t every article, by having
pa&#383;&#383;ed through a variety of hands, had become
enormou&#383;ly dear; which, operating with a real &#383;carcity of
many things, occa&#383;ioned by the war, had excited univer&#383;al
murmuring&#383; and inquietude. The Convention, who know the real
&#383;ource of the evil (the di&#383;credit of a&#383;&#383;ignats)
to be unattainable, and who are more &#383;olicitous to divert the
clamours of the people, than to &#383;upply their wants, have
adopted a mea&#383;ure which, according to the pre&#383;ent
appearances, will ruin one half of the nation, and &#383;tarve the
other. A maximum, or highe&#383;t price, beyond which nothing is to
be &#383;old, is now promulgated under very &#383;evere penalties
for all who &#383;hall infringe it. Such a regulation as this,
mu&#383;t, in its nature, be highly complex, and, by way of
&#383;implifying it, the price of every kind of merchandi&#383;e is
fixed at a third above what it bore in 1791: but as no
di&#383;tinction is made between the produce of the country, and
articles imported&mdash;between the &#383;mall retailer, who has
purcha&#383;ed perhaps at double the rate he i&#383; allowed to
&#383;ell at, and the whole&#383;ale &#383;peculator, this very
&#383;implification renders the whole ab&#383;urd and
inexecutable.&mdash;The re&#383;ult wa&#383; &#383;uch as might
have been expected; previous to the day on which the decree was to
take place, &#383;hopkeepers &#383;ecreted as many of their goods
as they could; and, when the day arrived, the people laid
&#383;iege to them in crowds, &#383;ome buying at the maximum,
others le&#383;s ceremonious, and in a few hours little remained in
the &#383;hop beyond the fixtures. The farmers have &#383;ince
brought neither butter nor eggs to market, the butchers refu&#383;e
to kill as u&#383;ual, and, in &#383;hort, nothing is to be
purcha&#383;ed openly. The country people, in&#383;tead of
&#383;elling provi&#383;ions publicly, take them to private
hou&#383;es; and, in addition to the former exorbitant prices, we
are taxed for the ri&#383;k that is incurred by evading the law. A
dozen of eggs, or a leg of mutton, are now conveyed from hou&#383;e
to hou&#383;e with as much my&#383;tery, as a ca&#383;e of
fire-arms, or a trea&#383;onable corre&#383;pondence; the whole
republic is in a &#383;ort of training like the Spartan youth; and
we are obliged to have recour&#383;e to dexterity and intrigue to
procure us a dinner.</p>
<p>Our legi&#383;lators, aware of what they term the
"ari&#383;tocratie marchande,"&mdash; that is to &#383;ay, that
trade&#383;men would naturally &#383;hut up their &#383;hops when
nothing was to be gained&mdash;provided, by a clau&#383;e in the
above law, that no one &#383;hould do this in le&#383;s time than a
year; but as the injunction only obliged them to keep the
&#383;hops open, and not to have goods to &#383;ell, every demand
is at fir&#383;t always an&#383;wered in the negative, till a
&#383;ort of intelligence becomes e&#383;tabli&#383;hed betwixt the
buyer and &#383;eller, when the former, if he may be tru&#383;ted,
is informed in a low key, that certain articles may be had, but not
au maximum.&mdash;Thus even the rich cannot obtain the
nece&#383;&#383;aries of life without difficulty and
&#383;ubmitting to impo&#383;ition&mdash;and the decent poor, who
will not pillage nor intimidate the trade&#383;men, are more
embarra&#383;&#383;ed than ever.</p>
<p>The above &#383;pecies of contraband commerce is carried on,
indeed, with great circum&#383;pection, and no avowed
ho&#383;tilities are attempted in the towns. The great war of the
maximum was waged with the farmers and higlers, as &#383;oon as it
was di&#383;covered that they took their commoditie&#383; privily
to &#383;uch people as they knew would buy at any price, rather
than not be &#383;upplied. In con&#383;equence, the guards were
ordered to &#383;top all refractory butter-women at the gates, and
conduct them to the town-hou&#383;e, where their merchandize was
di&#383;tributed, without pity or appeal, au maximum, to tho&#383;e
of the populace who could clamour loude&#383;t.</p>
<p>The&#383;e proceedings alarmed the pea&#383;ants, and our
markets became de&#383;erted. New &#383;tratagems, on one
&#383;ide, new attacks on the other. The &#383;ervants were forced
to &#383;upply them&#383;elves at private rendezvous in the night,
until &#383;ome were fined, and others arre&#383;ted; and the
&#383;earching all comers from the country became more intolerable
than the vexations of the ancient Gabelle.&mdash;Detachments of
dragoons are &#383;ent to &#383;cour the farm-yards, arre&#383;t
the farmers, and bring off in triumph whatever the re&#383;tive
hou&#383;ewives have ama&#383;&#383;ed, to be more profitably
di&#383;po&#383;ed of.</p>
<p>In this &#383;ituation we remain, and I &#383;uppo&#383;e
&#383;hall remain, while the law of the maximum continues in force.
The principle of it was certainly good, but it is found
impo&#383;&#383;ible to reduce it to practice &#383;o equitably as
to affect all alike: and as laws which are not executed are for the
mo&#383;t part rather pernicious than nugatory, informations,
arre&#383;ts, impo&#383;ition, and &#383;carcity are the only ends
which this mea&#383;ure &#383;eems to have an&#383;wered.</p>
<p>The hou&#383;es of detention, before in&#383;upportable, are now
yet more crouded with farmers and &#383;hopkeepers
&#383;u&#383;pected of oppo&#383;ing the law.&mdash;Many of the
former are &#383;o ignorant, as not to conceive that any
circum&#383;tances ought to deprive them of the right to &#383;ell
the produce of their farms at the highe&#383;t price they can get,
and regard the maximum much in the &#383;ame light as they would a
law to authorize robbing or hou&#383;ebreaking: as for the latter,
they are chiefly &#383;mall dealers, who bought dearer than they
have &#383;old, and are now impri&#383;oned for not &#383;elling
articles which they have not got. An informer by trade, or a
per&#383;onal enemy, lodges an accu&#383;ation again&#383;t a
particular trade&#383;man for concealing goods, or not &#383;elling
au maximum; and whether the accu&#383;ation be true or fal&#383;e,
if the accu&#383;ed i&#383; not in office, or a Jacobin, he has
very little chance of e&#383;caping impri&#383;onment.&mdash;It is
certain, that if the per&#383;ecution of the&#383;e
cla&#383;&#383;es of people continue, and commerce (already nearly
annihilated by the war) be thus &#383;hackled, an ab&#383;olute
want of various articles of primary con&#383;umption mu&#383;t
en&#383;ue; but if Paris and the armies can be &#383;upplied, the
&#383;tarving the departments will be a mere plea&#383;urable
experiment to their humane repre&#383;entative&#383;!</p>

<h2>March 1, 1794.</h2>
<p>The freedom of the pre&#383;s is &#383;o perfectly well
regulated, that it is not &#383;urprizing we are indulged with the
permi&#383;&#383;ion of &#383;eeing the public papers: yet this
indulgence is often, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, a &#383;ource of much
perplexity to me&mdash;our more intimate a&#383;&#383;ociates know
that I am a native of England, and as often as any debates of our
Hou&#383;e of Commons are publi&#383;hed, they apply to me for
explanations which it is not always in my power to give them. I
have in vain endeavoured to make them comprehend the nature of an
oppo&#383;ition from &#383;y&#383;tem, &#383;o that when they
&#383;ee any thing advanced by a member exactly the rever&#383;e of
truth, they are wondering how he can be &#383;o ill informed, and
never &#383;u&#383;pect him of &#383;aying what he doe&#383; not
believe him&#383;elf. It mu&#383;t be confe&#383;&#383;ed, however,
that our extract&#383; from the Engli&#383;h papers often form
&#383;o complete a contra&#383;t with facts, that a foreigner
unacquainted with the tactics of profe&#383;&#383;ional
patrioti&#383;m, may very naturally read them with &#383;ome
&#383;urprize. A noble Peer, for example, (who&#383;e wi&#383;dom
is not to be di&#383;puted, &#383;ince the Abbe Mably calls him the
Engli&#383;h Socrates,*) a&#383;&#383;erts that the French
troop&#383; are the be&#383;t clothed in Europe; yet letters, of
nearly the &#383;ame date with the Earl's &#383;peech, from two
Generals and a Deputy at the head of different armies intreat a
&#383;upply of covering for their denudated legions, and add, that
they are obliged to march in wooden &#383;hoe&#383;!**</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It is &#383;urely a reflection on the Engli&#383;h
di&#383;cernment not to have adopted this happy appellation, in
which, however, as well as in many other parts of "the rights of
Man and the Citizen," the Abbe &#383;eems to have con&#383;ulted
his own zeal, rather than the noble Peer'&#383; mode&#383;ty. ** If
the French troops are now better clothed, it is the effect of
requi&#383;itions and pre-emptions, which have ruined the
manufacturers. &mdash;Patriots of the North, would you wi&#383;h to
&#383;ee our &#383;oldiers clothed by the &#383;ame
means?</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;On another occa&#383;ion, your Briti&#383;h Sage
de&#383;cribes, with great eloquence, the enthu&#383;ia&#383;m with
which the youth of France "&#383;tart to arms at the call of the
Convention;" while the peaceful citizen anticipates, with equal
eagerne&#383;s, the le&#383;s glorious injunction to extract
&#383;altpetre.&mdash;The revolts, and the coercion,
nece&#383;&#383;ary to enforce the departure of the fir&#383;t
levies (however fear, &#383;hame, and di&#383;cipline, may have
&#383;ince made them &#383;oldiers, though not republicans) might
have corrected the ardour of the orator's inventive talents; and
the zeal of the French in manufacturing &#383;alpetre, has been of
&#383;o &#383;low a growth, that any reference to it is peculiarly
unlucky. For &#383;everal months the Convention ha&#383;
recommended, invited, intreated, and ordered the whole country to
occupy them&#383;elves in the proce&#383;s nece&#383;&#383;ary for
obtaining nitre; but the republican enthu&#383;ia&#383;m was
&#383;o tardy, that &#383;carcely an ounce appeared, till a long
li&#383;t of &#383;ound penal laws, with fines and
impri&#383;onments in every line, rou&#383;ed the public
&#383;pirit more effectually.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Two years impri&#383;onment was the puni&#383;hment
a&#383;&#383;igned to a Citizen who &#383;hould be found to
ob&#383;truct in any way the fabricating &#383;altpetre. If you had
a hou&#383;e that was adjudged to contain the materials required,
and expo&#383;tulated again&#383;t pulling it down, the penalty was
incurred.&mdash;I believe &#383;omething of this kind exi&#383;ted
under the old government, the abu&#383;es of which are the only
parts the republic &#383;eems to have pre&#383;erved.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Another cau&#383;e al&#383;o has much favoured the
exten&#383;ion of this manufacture: the nece&#383;&#383;ity of
procuring gunpowder at any rate has &#383;ecured an exemption from
&#383;erving in the army to tho&#383;e who &#383;hall be employed
in making it.&mdash;*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Many, under this pretext, even procured their
di&#383;charge from the army; and it was eventually found
requi&#383;ite to &#383;top this commutation of &#383;ervice by a
decree.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;On this account va&#383;t numbers of young men,
who&#383;e martial propen&#383;itie&#383; are not too vehement for
calculation, con&#383;idering the extraction of &#383;altpetre as
more &#383;afe than the u&#383;e of it, have &#383;eriou&#383;ly
devoted them&#383;elves to the bu&#383;ine&#383;s. Thus, between
fear of the Convention and of the enemy, has been produced that
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m which &#383;eems &#383;o grateful to Lord
S____. Yet, if the French are &#383;truck by the
di&#383;&#383;imilitude of fact&#383; with the language of your
Engli&#383;h patriots, there are other circum&#383;tance&#383;
which appear &#383;till more unaccountable to them. I acknowledge
the word patrioti&#383;m is not perfectly under&#383;tood any where
in France, nor do my pri&#383;on-a&#383;&#383;ociates abound in it;
but &#383;till they find it difficult to reconcile the love of
their country, &#383;o exclu&#383;ively boa&#383;ted by certain
&#383;enators, with their eulogiums on a government, and on men who
avow an implacable hatred to it, and are the profe&#383;&#383;ed
agents of its future de&#383;truction. The Hou&#383;es of Lords and
Commons re&#383;ound with panegyrics on France; the Convention with
<i>"delenda e&#383;t Carthate"&mdash;"ces vil&#383;
In&#383;ulaire&#383;"&mdash;"de peuple marchand,
boutiquier"&mdash;"ces laches Angloi&#383;"</i>. ("Carthage
mu&#383;t be de&#383;troyed"&mdash;"tho&#383;e vile
I&#383;lander&#383;"&mdash;"that nation of
&#383;hopkeeper&#383;"&mdash;"tho&#383;e cowardly
Engli&#383;hmen"&mdash;&amp;c.)</p>
<p>The efforts of the Engli&#383;h patriots overtly tend to the
con&#383;olidation of the French republic, while the demagogues of
France are yet more &#383;trenuous for the abolition of monarchy in
England. The virtues of certain people called Muir and Palmer,* are
at once the theme of Mr. Fox and Robe&#383;pierre,** of Mr. Grey
and Barrere,***, of Collot d'Herboi&#383;**** and Mr. Sheridan; and
their fate is lamented as much at the Jacobins a&#383; at St.
Stephen's.*****</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

re&#383;pect due to their celebrity, their friends mu&#383;t pardon
me. To &#383;ay truth, I did not at this time think of them with
much complacence, as I had heard of them only from the Jacobins, by
whom they were repre&#383;ented as the leaders of a Convention,
which was to arm ninety thou&#383;and men, for the
e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of a &#383;y&#383;tem &#383;imilar to that

triumphing in the overthrow of the Briti&#383;h con&#383;titution,
and the dethronement of the King. *** If we may credit the

which might be of di&#383;&#383;ervice to their unfortunate friends
during their trial.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;The conduct of Mr. Pitt is not more acrimoniou&#383;ly
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed at the Palais National than by a part of
his colleagues; and the cen&#383;ure of the Briti&#383;h
government, which is now the order of the day at the Jacobins,
i&#383; nearly the echo of your parliamentary debates.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Allowing for the difference of education in the
orators, a journeyman &#383;hoemaker was, I think, as eloquent, and
not more abu&#383;ive, than the facetious _ci-devant_ protege of

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;All this, however, does not appear to me out of the
natural order of things; it is the &#383;orry hi&#383;tory of
oppo&#383;ition for a century and an half, and our political
rectitude, I fear, is not increa&#383;ing: but the French, who are
in their way the mo&#383;t corrupt people in Europe, have not
hitherto, from the nature of their government, been familiar with
thi&#383; particular mode of provoking corruption, nor are they at
pre&#383;ent likely to become &#383;o. Indeed, I mu&#383;t here
ob&#383;erve, that your Engli&#383;h Jacobins, if they are
wi&#383;e, &#383;hould not attempt to introduce the revolutionary
&#383;y&#383;tem; for though the total
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of &#383;uch a government is very
alluring, yet the prudence, which looks to futurity, and the
incertitude of &#383;ublunary events, mu&#383;t acknowledge it is
"Cae&#383;ar or nothing;" and that it offers no re&#383;ource in
ca&#383;e of tho&#383;e &#383;egregations, which the jealou&#383;y
of power, or the appropriation of &#383;poil, may occa&#383;ion,
even among&#383;t the mo&#383;t virtuous
a&#383;&#383;ociates.&mdash;The eloquence of a di&#383;contented
orator is here &#383;ilenced, not by a pen&#383;ion, but by a
mandat d'arret; and the ob&#383;tinate patrioti&#383;m, which with
you could not be &#383;oftened with le&#383;s than a participation
of authority, is more cheaply &#383;ecured by the Guillotine. A
menace is more efficacious than a bribe, and in this re&#383;pect I
agree with Mr. Thomas Paine,* that a republic is undoubtedly more
oeconomical than a monarchy; be&#383;ides, that being conducted on
&#383;uch principles, it has the advantage of &#383;implifying the
&#383;cience of government, as it con&#383;ult&#383; neither the
intere&#383;ts nor weakne&#383;&#383;es of mankind; and,
di&#383;daining to admini&#383;ter either to avarice or vanity,
&#383;ubdues its enemies by the &#383;ole influence of
terror.&mdash;*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This gentleman's fate is truly to be pitied. After
rejecting, a&#383; his friends a&#383;&#383;ert, two hundred a year
from the Engli&#383;h Mini&#383;try, he is obliged now to be
&#383;ilent gratis, with the additional de&#383;agrement of
occupying a corner in the Luxembourg.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Adieu!&mdash;Heaven knows how often I may have to repeat
the word thu&#383; unmeaningly. I &#383;it here, like Pope's bard
"lulled by &#383;oft zephyr&#383; through the broken pane," and
&#383;cribbling high-&#383;ounding phra&#383;es of monarchy,
patrioti&#383;m, and republics, while I forget the humbler
&#383;ubject of our wants and embarra&#383;&#383;ments. We can
&#383;carcely procure either bread, meat, or any thing el&#383;e:
the hou&#383;e is crouded by an importation of pri&#383;oners from
Abbeville, and we are more &#383;trictly guarded than ever. My
friend ennuyes as u&#383;ual, and I grow impatient, not having
&#383;ang froid enough for a true French ennuie in a &#383;ituation
that would tempt one to hang one's &#383;elf.</p>

<h2>March, 1794.</h2>
<p>The a&#383;pect of the times promi&#383;es no change in our
favour; on the contrary, every day &#383;eems to bring its
attendant evil. The gentry who had e&#383;caped the
comprehen&#383;ive decree again&#383;t &#383;u&#383;pected people,
are now &#383;wept away in this and the three neighbouring
departments by a private order of the repre&#383;entatives, St.
Ju&#383;t, Lebas, and Dumont.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The order was to arre&#383;t, without exception, all
the ci-devant Noble&#383;&#383;&#383;e, men, women, and children,
in the departments of the Somme, North, and Pas de Calais, and to
exclude them rigourou&#383;ly from all external
communication&mdash;(mettre au &#383;ecret).</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;A &#383;everer regimen is to be adopted in the
pri&#383;ons, and hu&#383;bands are already &#383;eparated from
their wives, and fathers from their daughters, for the
purpo&#383;e, as it is alledged, of pre&#383;erving good morals.
Both thi&#383; place and the Bicetre being too full to admit of
more inhabitants, two large buildings in the town are now
appropriated to the male pri&#383;oners.&mdash; My friends continue
at Arras, and, I fear, in extreme di&#383;tre&#383;s. I
under&#383;tand they have been plundered of what things they had
with them, and the little &#383;upply I was able to &#383;end them
was intercepted by &#383;ome of the harpies of the pri&#383;ons.
Mrs. D____'s health has not been able to &#383;u&#383;tain
the&#383;e accumulated mi&#383;fortunes, and &#383;he is at
pre&#383;ent at the ho&#383;pital. All this is far from enlivening,
even had I a larger &#383;hare of the national philo&#383;ophy; and
did I not oftener make what I ob&#383;erve, than what I
&#383;uffer, the &#383;ubject of my letters, I &#383;hould tax your
patience a&#383; much by repetition, as I may by dullne&#383;s.</p>
<p>When I enumerated in my la&#383;t letters a few of the
obligations the French have to their friends in England, I ought
al&#383;o to have ob&#383;erved, with how little gratitude they
behave to tho&#383;e who are here. Without mentioning Mr. Thomas
Paine, who&#383;e per&#383;ecution will doubtle&#383;s be recorded
by abler pens, nothing, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, can be more
unplea&#383;ant than the &#383;ituation of one of the&#383;e
Anglo-Gallican patriots. The republicans, &#383;uppo&#383;ing that
an Engli&#383;hman who affects a partiality for them can be only a
&#383;py, execute all the laws, which concern foreigners, upon him
with additional rigour;* and when an Engli&#383;h Jacobin arrives
in pri&#383;on, far from meeting with con&#383;olation or
&#383;ympathy, his di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es are beheld with
triumph, and hi&#383; per&#383;on avoided with abhorrence. They
talk much here of a gentleman, of very democratic principles, who
left the pri&#383;on before I came. It &#383;eems, that,
notwith&#383;tanding Dumont conde&#383;cended to vi&#383;it at his
hou&#383;e, and wa&#383; on terms of intimacy with him, he was
arre&#383;ted, and not di&#383;tingui&#383;hed from the re&#383;t
of his countrymen, except by being more har&#383;hly treated. The
ca&#383;e of this unfortunate gentleman was rendered peculiarly
amu&#383;ing to his companions, and mortifying to him&#383;elf, by
his having a very pretty mi&#383;tre&#383;s, who had
&#383;ufficient influence over Dumont to obtain any thing but the
liberation of her protector. The Deputy was on this head
inflexible; doubtle&#383;s, as a proof of his impartial
ob&#383;ervance of the laws, and to &#383;how that, like the
ju&#383;t man in Horace, he de&#383;pi&#383;ed the clamour of the
vulgar, who did not &#383;cruple to hint, that the crime of our
countryman was rather of a moral than a political nature&mdash;that
he wa&#383; unaccommodating, and recalcitrant&mdash;addicted to
&#383;u&#383;picions and jealou&#383;ies, which it was thought
charitable to cure him of, by a little whole&#383;ome
&#383;eclu&#383;ion. In fact, the &#383;ummary of this gentleman's
hi&#383;tory is not calculated to tempt his fellow
&#383;ocieti&#383;ts on your &#383;ide of the water to imitate his
example.&mdash;After taking refuge in France from the tyranny and
di&#383;appointments he experienced in England, and purcha&#383;ing
a large national property to &#383;ecure him&#383;elf the rights of
a citizen, he i&#383; awakened from his dream of freedom, to find
him&#383;elf lodged in a pri&#383;on, his e&#383;tate under
&#383;eque&#383;tration, and his mi&#383;tre&#383;s in
requi&#383;ition.&mdash;Let u&#383; leave this Coriolanus among the
Vol&#383;cian&#383;&mdash;it is a per&#383;ecution to make
converts, rather than martyrs, and</p>

<h2>March 5, 1794.</h2>
<p>Of what &#383;trange influence is this word revolution, that it
&#383;hould thus, like a tali&#383;man of romance, keep inchained,
as it were, the rea&#383;oning faculties of twenty millions of
people! France is at this moment looking for the deci&#383;ion of
its fate in the quarrels of two mi&#383;erable clubs, compo&#383;ed
of individuals who are either de&#383;pi&#383;ed or dete&#383;ted.
The municipality of Paris favours the Cordeliers, the Convention
the Jacobins; and it is ea&#383;y to perceive, that in this cafe
the auxiliarie&#383; are principals, and mu&#383;t &#383;hortly
come to &#383;uch an open rupture, as will end in the
de&#383;truction of either one or the other. The world would be
uninhabitable, could the combinations of the wicked be permanent;
and it is fortunate for the tranquil and upright part of mankind,
that the attainment of the purpo&#383;es for which &#383;uch
combinations are formed, i&#383; u&#383;ually the &#383;ignal of
their di&#383;&#383;olution.</p>
<p>The municipality of Paris had been the iniquitous drudges of the
Jacobin party in the legi&#383;lative a&#383;&#383;embly&mdash;they
were made the in&#383;truments of ma&#383;&#383;acring the
pri&#383;oners,* of dethroning and executing the king,** and
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively of de&#383;troying the
Bri&#383;&#383;otine faction,*** filling the pri&#383;on&#383; with
all who were obnoxious to the republicans,**** and of involving a
repentant nation in the irremidiable guilt of the Queen's
death.&mdash;*****</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It is well known that the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins were hired and paid by the
municipality, and that &#383;ome of the members pre&#383;ided at
the&#383;e horror&#383; in their &#383;carfs of office. ** The
whole of what is called the revolution of the 10th of Augu&#383;t
may very ju&#383;tly be a&#383;cribed to the municipality of
Pari&#383;&mdash;I mean the active part of it. The planning and
political part has been &#383;o often di&#383;puted by different
members of the Convention, that it i&#383; not ea&#383;y to decide
on any thing, except that the very terms of the&#383;e
di&#383;putes fully evince, that the people at large, and more
particularly the departments, were both innocent, and, until it
took place, ignorant of an event which has plunged the country into
&#383;o many crimes and calamities. *** A former impri&#383;onment
of Hebert formed a principal charge again&#383;t the
Bri&#383;&#383;otines, and, indeed, the one that was mo&#383;t
in&#383;i&#383;ted on at their trial, if we except that of having
precipitated France into a war with England.&mdash;It mu&#383;t be
difficult for the Engli&#383;h Jacobins to decide on this
occa&#383;ion between the virtues of their dead friends and
tho&#383;e of their living ones. **** The famous definition of
&#383;u&#383;pected per&#383;ons originated with the municipality
of Paris. ***** It is certain that tho&#383;e who, deceived by the
calumnies of faction, permitted, if not a&#383;&#383;ented to, the
King's death, at thi&#383; time regretted it; and I believe I have
before ob&#383;erved, that one of the rea&#383;ons urged in
&#383;upport of the expediency of putting the Queen to death, was,
that it would make the army and people deci&#383;ive, by
bani&#383;hing all hope of peace or accommodation. See the
<i>Moniteur</i> of that time, which, as I have el&#383;ewhere
ob&#383;erved, may be alway&#383; con&#383;idered as
official.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;The&#383;e &#383;ervices being too great for adequate
reward, were not rewarded at all; and the municipality, tired of
the odium of crime, without the participation of power, has
&#383;eized on its portion of tyranny; while the convention, at
once jealous and timid, exa&#383;perated and doubtful, yet menaces
with the trepidation of a rival, rather than with the &#383;ecurity
of a conqueror.</p>
<p>Hebert, the Deputy-&#383;olicitor for the commune of Paris,
appears on thi&#383; occa&#383;ion as the opponent of the whole
legi&#383;lature; and all the temporizing eloquence of Barrere, and
the my&#383;terious phra&#383;eology of Robe&#383;pierre, are
employed to decry his morals, and to reproach the mini&#383;ters
with the &#383;ums which have been the price of his
labours.&mdash;*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Five thou&#383;and pounds, two thou&#383;and pounds,
and other con&#383;iderable &#383;ums, were paid to Hebert for
&#383;upplying the army with his paper, called "La Pere Duchene."
Let whoever has read one of them, conceive the nature of a
government to which &#383;uch &#383;upport wa&#383;
nece&#383;&#383;ary, which &#383;uppo&#383;ed its intere&#383;ts
promoted by a total extinction of morals, decency, and religion. I
could almo&#383;t wi&#383;h, for the &#383;ake of exhibiting vice
under its mo&#383;t odious colours, that my &#383;ex and my country
permitted me to quote one.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Virtuous republican&#383;! the morals of Hebert were pure
when he outraged humanity in his accu&#383;ations of the
Queen&mdash;they were pure when he pro&#383;trated the &#383;tupid
multitude at the feet of a Godde&#383;s of Rea&#383;on;* they were
pure while his execrable paper &#383;erved to corrupt the army, and
to eradicate every principle which yet di&#383;tingui&#383;hed the
French as a civilized people.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Madame Momoro, the unfortunate woman who expo&#383;ed
her&#383;elf in thi&#383; pageant, was guillotined as an accomplice
of Hebert, together with the wives of Hebert and Camille
De&#383;moulins.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Yet, atrocious as his crimes are, they form half the
Magna Charta of the republic,* and the authority of the Convention
is &#383;till &#383;upported by them.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* What are the death of the King, and the murders of
Augu&#383;t and September, 1792, but the Magna Charta of the
republicans?</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;It is his per&#383;on, not his guilt, that is
pro&#383;cribed; and if the one be threatened with the
&#383;caffold, the fruits of the other are held &#383;acred. He
will fall a &#383;acrifice&mdash;not to offended religion or
morality, but to the fears and re&#383;entment of his
accomplice&#383;!</p>
<p>Amid&#383;t the di&#383;&#383;entions of two parties, between
which neither rea&#383;on nor humanity can di&#383;cover a
preference, a third &#383;eems to have formed it&#383;elf, equally
inimical to, and hated by both. At the head of it are Danton,
Camille De&#383;moulins, Philipeaux, &amp;c.&mdash;I own I have no
better opinion of the integrity of the&#383;e, than of the
re&#383;t; but they profe&#383;s them&#383;elves the advocates of a
&#383;y&#383;tem of mildne&#383;s and moderation, and,
&#383;ituated as thi&#383; country is at pre&#383;ent, even the
affectation of virtue is captivating.&mdash; As far as they dare,
the people are partial to them: bending beneath the weight of a
&#383;anguinary and turbulent de&#383;poti&#383;m, if they
&#383;igh not for freedom, they do for repo&#383;e; and the
hara&#383;&#383;ed mind, bereft of its own energy, looks up with
indolent hope for relief from a change of factions. They forget
that Danton is actuated by ambitious jealou&#383;y, that Camille
De&#383;moulins is hacknied in the atrocities of the revolution,
and that their partizans are adventurers, with neither honour nor
morals. Yet, after all, if they will de&#383;troy a few of the
guillotines, open our ba&#383;tilles, and give us at lea&#383;t the
&#383;ecurity of &#383;ervitude, we &#383;hall be content to leave
the&#383;e retro&#383;pections to po&#383;terity, and be thankful
that in this our day the wicked &#383;ometimes perceive it their
intere&#383;t to do good.</p>
<p>In this &#383;tate of &#383;eclu&#383;ion, when I remark to you
the temper of the public at any important cri&#383;is, you are,
perhaps, curious to know my &#383;ources of intelligence; but
&#383;uch details are unnece&#383;&#383;ary. I might, indeed, write
you a manuel des pri&#383;ons, and, like Trenck or Latude, by a
vain di&#383;play of ingenuity, deprive &#383;ome future victim of
a re&#383;ource. It is enough, that Providence it&#383;elf
&#383;eems to aid our invention, when its object is to elude
tyranny; be&#383;ides that a con&#383;tant acce&#383;&#383;ion of
pri&#383;oners from all parts, who are too numerous to be kept
&#383;eparate, nece&#383;&#383;arily circulate&#383; among us
whatever pa&#383;&#383;es in the world.</p>
<p>The Convention has lately made a &#383;ort of <i>pas
retrogade</i> [Retrogade movement.] in the doctrine of holy
equality, by decreeing, that every officer who has a command
&#383;hall be able to read and write, though it cannot be denied
that their rea&#383;ons for this le&#383;e democratie are of
&#383;ome weight. All gentlemen, or, as it is expre&#383;&#383;ed
here, noble&#383;&#383;e, have been recalled from the army, and
replaced by officers cho&#383;en by the &#383;oldier&#383;
them&#383;elves, [Under the rank of field-officers.] who&#383;e
affections are often conciliated by qualities not
e&#383;&#383;entially military, though &#383;ometime&#383;
profe&#383;&#383;ional. A buffoon, or a pot-companion, is, of
cour&#383;e, often more popular than a di&#383;ciplinarian; and the
brighte&#383;t talents lo&#383;e their influence when put in
competition with a head that can bear a greater number of
bottles.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Hence it happened, that a po&#383;t was
&#383;ometimes confided to one who could not read the parole and
counter&#383;ign; expeditions failed, becau&#383;e commanding
officers mi&#383;took on the map a river for a road, or woods for
mountains; and the mo&#383;t &#383;ecret orders were betrayed
through the inability of tho&#383;e to whom they were
entru&#383;ted to read them.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;Yet this reading and writing are a &#383;ort of
ari&#383;tocratic di&#383;tinctions, and not among the primeval
rights of man; &#383;o that it is po&#383;&#383;ible your
Engli&#383;h patriots will not approve of any regulations founded
on them. But this is not the only point on which there is an
apparent di&#383;cordance between them and their friends
here&mdash;the &#383;everity of Me&#383;&#383;rs. Muir and Palmer's
&#383;entence is pathetically lamented in the Hou&#383;e of
Commons, while the Tribunal Revolutionnaire (in obedience to
private orders) i&#383; petitioning, that any di&#383;re&#383;pect
towards the convention &#383;hall be puni&#383;hed with death. In
England, it is a&#383;&#383;erted, that the people have a right to
decide on the continuation of the war&mdash;here it is
propo&#383;ed to declare &#383;u&#383;picious, and treat
accordingly, all who &#383;hall dare talk of peace.&mdash;Mr. Fox
and Robe&#383;pierre mu&#383;t &#383;ettle the&#383;e trifling
variations at the general congre&#383;s of republicans, when the
latter &#383;hall (as they profe&#383;s) have dethroned all the
potentates in Europe!</p>
<p>Do you not read of cart-loads of patriotic gifts,* bales of lint
and bandages, and &#383;tockings, knit by the hands of fair
citizens, for the u&#383;e of the &#383;oldiers?</p>

to the Convention for defraying the expences and repairs of the
guillotine.&mdash;I know not if it were intended patriotically or
correctionally; but the legi&#383;lative delicacy was hurt, and the
bearer of the gift ordered for examination to the Committee of
General Safety, who mo&#383;t probably &#383;ent him to expiate
either his patrioti&#383;m or his plea&#383;antry in a

<h2>March 17, 1794.</h2>
<p>After &#383;ome days of agitation and &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e,
we learn that the popularity of Robe&#383;pierre is victorious, and
that Hebert and his partizans are arre&#383;ted. Were the
intrin&#383;ic claims of either party con&#383;idered, without
regard to the circum&#383;tances of the moment, it might &#383;eem
&#383;trange I &#383;hould expre&#383;s my&#383;elf as though the
re&#383;ult of a conte&#383;t between &#383;uch men could excite a
general intere&#383;t: yet a people &#383;adly &#383;killed in the
gradation&#383; of evil, and inured to a choice only of what is
bad, learn to prefer comparatively, with no other view than that of
adopting what may be lea&#383;t injurious to them&#383;elves; and
the merit of the object is out of the que&#383;tion. Hence it is,
that the public wi&#383;h was in favour of Robe&#383;pierre; for,
be&#383;ides that his cautious character has given him an advantage
over the undi&#383;gui&#383;ed profligacy of Hebert, it is
conjectured by many, that the more merciful politics
profe&#383;&#383;ed by Camille De&#383;moulins, are &#383;ecretly
&#383;ugge&#383;ted, or, at lea&#383;t a&#383;&#383;ented to, by
the former.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This was the opinion of many.&mdash;The Convention
and the Jacobins had taken alarm at a paper called "The Old
Cordelier," written by Camille De&#383;moulins, apparently with a
view to introduce a milder &#383;y&#383;tem of government. The
author had been cen&#383;ured at the one, expelled the other, and
defended by Robe&#383;pierre, who &#383;eems not to have abandoned
him until he found the Convention re&#383;olved to
per&#383;i&#383;t in the &#383;anguinary plan they had adopted.
Robe&#383;pierre afterward&#383; &#383;acrificed his friends to
retrieve his influence; but could hi&#383; views have been
an&#383;wered by humane mea&#383;ures, as certainly as by cruel
ones, I think he would have preferred the fir&#383;t; for I repeat,
that the Convention at large were aver&#383;e from any thing like
rea&#383;on or ju&#383;tice, and Robe&#383;pierre more than once
ri&#383;ked his popularity by profe&#383;&#383;ions of
moderation.&mdash;The mo&#383;t eloquent &#383;peech I have
&#383;een of his was previous to the death of Danton, and it
&#383;eems evidently intended to &#383;ound the principles of his
colleagues as to a change of &#383;y&#383;tem.&mdash;Camille
De&#383;moulins has excited &#383;ome intere&#383;t, and has been
deemed a kind of martyr to humanity. Perhaps nothing marks the
horrors of the time more than &#383;uch a partiality.&mdash;Camille
De&#383;moulins, under an appearance of &#383;implicity, was an
adventurer, who&#383;e pen had been employed to mi&#383;lead the
people from the beginning of the revolution. He had been very
active on the 10th of Augu&#383;t; and even in the papers which
have given him a comparative reputation, he is the panegyri&#383;t
of Marat, and recommends "une Guillotine economique;" that is, a
di&#383;crimination in favour of him&#383;elf and his party, who
now began to fear they might them&#383;elve&#383; be
&#383;acrificed by the Convention and de&#383;erted by
Robe&#383;pierre&mdash;after being the accomplices and tools of
both.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The vici&#383;&#383;itudes of the revolution have hitherto
offered nothing but a change of vices and of parties; nor can I
regard this defeat of the municipality of Paris as any thing more:
the event is, however, important, and will probably have great
influence on the future.</p>
<p>After having &#383;o long authorized, and profited by, the
crimes of tho&#383;e they have now &#383;acrificed, the Convention
are willing to have it &#383;uppo&#383;ed they were them&#383;elves
held in &#383;ubjection by Hebert and the other
repre&#383;entatives of the Pari&#383;ian mob.&mdash;Admitting this
to be true, having regained their independence, we ought naturally
to expect a more rational and humane &#383;y&#383;tem will take
place; but this is a mere hope, and the pre&#383;ent occurrences
are far from ju&#383;tifying it. We hear much of the guilt of the
fallen party, and little of remedying its effect&#383;&mdash;much
of puni&#383;hment, and little of reform; and the people are
excited to vengeance, without being permitted to claim
redre&#383;s. In the meanwhile, fearful of tru&#383;ting to the
cold preference which they owe to a &#383;uperior abhorrence of
their adver&#383;aries, the Convention have ordered their
colleagues on mi&#383;&#383;ion to glean the few arms &#383;till
remaining in the hand&#383; of the National Guard, and to
arre&#383;t all who may be &#383;u&#383;pected of connection with
the adver&#383;e party.&mdash;Dumont has performed this
&#383;ervice here very diligently; and, by way of
&#383;upererogation, has &#383;ent the Commandant of Amiens to the
Bicetre, his wife, who was ill, to the ho&#383;pital, and two young
children to this place.</p>
<p>As u&#383;ual, the&#383;e proceedings excite &#383;ecret
murmurs, but are neverthele&#383;&#383; yielded to with perfect
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>One can never, on the&#383;e occa&#383;ions, cea&#383;e admiring
the endurance of the French character. In other countries, at every
change of party, the people are flattered with the pro&#383;pect of
advantage, or conciliated by indulgences; but here they gain
nothing by change, except an accumulation of
oppre&#383;&#383;ion&mdash;and the &#383;ucce&#383;s of a new party
is always the harbinger of &#383;ome new tyranny. While the fall of
Hebert is proclaimed as the triumph of freedom, all the citizens
are di&#383;armed by way of collateral &#383;ecurity; and at the
in&#383;tant he is accu&#383;ed by the Convention of athei&#383;m
and immorality,* a militant police is &#383;ent forth to
deva&#383;tate the churches, and puni&#383;h tho&#383;e who are
detected in ob&#383;erving the Sabbath&mdash;<i>"mais plutot
&#383;ouffrir que mourir, c'e&#383;t la devi&#383;e des
Francois."</i> ["To &#383;uffer rather than die is the motto of
Frenchmen."]</p>
<blockquote>

religion was never more violent than at the time when the
Convention were anathematizing Hebert and his party for

that the &#383;aid Chabot, and four or five of his colleagues in
the Convention, had been bribed to &#383;erve a &#383;tock-jobbing
bu&#383;ine&#383;s at a &#383;tipulated &#383;um,* and that the

patriots of &#383;uch note, but that the intrigues and popular
character of Chabot made it nece&#383;&#383;ary to
di&#383;po&#383;e of him, and his accomplices &#383;uffered to give

<p>&mdash;Chabot, with great rea&#383;on, in&#383;i&#383;ted on his
claim to an extra &#383;hare, on account, as he expre&#383;&#383;ed
it, of having the reputation of one of the fir&#383;t patriots in
Europe. Now this I look upon to be a very u&#383;eful hint, as it
tends to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a tariff of reputations, rather than
of talents. In England, you di&#383;tingui&#383;h too much in
favour of the latter; and, in a que&#383;tion of purcha&#383;e, a
Mini&#383;ter often prefers a "commodity" of rhetoricians, to one
of "good names."&mdash;I confe&#383;s, I am of Chabot'&#383;
opinion; and think a vote from a member who has &#383;ome
reputation for hone&#383;ty, ought to be better paid for than the
eloquence which, weakened by the vices of the orator, cea&#383;es
to per&#383;uade. How it is that the patriotic harangues at St.
Stephen's &#383;erve only to amu&#383;e the auditors, who identify
the &#383;entiments they expre&#383;s as little with the
&#383;peaker, a&#383; they would tho&#383;e of Cato's
&#383;oliloquy with the actor who per&#383;onates the character for
the night? I fear the people rea&#383;on like Chabot, and are
"fools to fame." Perhaps it is fortunate for England, that
tho&#383;e who&#383;e talents and principles would make them
mo&#383;t dangerous, are become lea&#383;t &#383;o, becau&#383;e
both are counteracted by the public contempt. Ought it not to
humble the pride, and correct the errors, which too often accompany
great genius, that the meane&#383;t capacity can
di&#383;tingui&#383;h between talent&#383; and virtue; and that
even in the moment our wonder is excited by the one, a &#383;ort of
intrin&#383;ic preference is given to the other?&mdash;Yours,

<h2>Providence, April 15, 1794.</h2>
<p>"The friend&#383;hip of bad men turns to fear:" and in this
&#383;ingle phra&#383;e of our popular bard is comprized the
hi&#383;tory of all the parties who have &#383;ucceeded each other
during the revolution.&mdash;Danton has been &#383;acrificed to
Robe&#383;pierre's jealou&#383;y,* and Camille De&#383;moulins to
&#383;upport hi&#383; popularity;** and both, after &#383;haring in
the crimes, and contributing to the puni&#383;hment, of Hebert and
his a&#383;&#383;ociates, have followed them to the &#383;ame
&#383;caffold.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The ferocious courage of Danton had, on the 10th of
Augu&#383;t, the 2d of September, the 31&#383;t of May, and other
occa&#383;ions, been the ductile in&#383;trument of
Robe&#383;pierre; but, in the cour&#383;e of their iniquitou&#383;
connection, it &#383;hould &#383;eem, they had committed
them&#383;elves too much to each other. Danton had betrayed a
de&#383;ire of more exclu&#383;ively profiting by his crimes; and
Robe&#383;pierre's views been equally ambitious, though le&#383;s
daring, their mutual jealou&#383;ies had ri&#383;en to a height
which rendered the &#383;acrifice of one party
nece&#383;&#383;ary&mdash;and Robe&#383;pierre had the addre&#383;s
to &#383;ecure him&#383;elf, by &#383;triking the fir&#383;t blow.
They had &#383;upped in the country, and returned together to
Paris, on the night Danton was arre&#383;ted; and, it may be
&#383;uppo&#383;ed, that in this interview, which was intended to
produce a reconciliation, they had been convinced that neither was
to be tru&#383;ted by the other. ** There can be no doubt but
Robe&#383;pierre had encouraged Camille De&#383;moulins to
publi&#383;h his paper, intitled "The Old Cordelier," in which
&#383;ome tran&#383;lations from Tacitus, de&#383;criptive of every
kind of tyranny, were applied to the times, and a change of
&#383;y&#383;tem indirectly propo&#383;ed. The publication became
highly popular, except with the Convention and the Jacobins;
the&#383;e, however, it wa&#383; requi&#383;ite for
Robe&#383;pierre to conciliate; and Camille De&#383;moulins
wa&#383; &#383;acrificed, to prove that he did not favour the
obnoxious moderation of his friend.</blockquote>

<p>I know not if one's heart gain any thing by this habitual
contemplation of &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ive victims, who ought not
to in&#383;pire pity, and whom ju&#383;tice and humanity forbid one
to regret.&mdash;How many parties have fallen, who &#383;eem to
have laboured only to tran&#383;mit a dear-bought tyranny, which
they had not time to enjoy them&#383;elves, to their
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ors: The French revolutioni&#383;ts may,
indeed, adopt the motto of Virgil's Bees, "Not for our&#383;elves,
but for you." The mon&#383;trous powers claimed for the Convention
by the Bri&#383;&#383;otines,* with the hope of exclu&#383;ively
exerci&#383;ing them, were fatal to them&#383;elve&#383;&mdash;the
party that overthrew the Bri&#383;&#383;otines in its turn became
in&#383;ignificant&mdash;and a &#383;mall number of them only,
under the de&#383;cription of Committees of Public Welfare and
General Safety, gradually u&#383;urped the whole authority.</p>

of Augu&#383;t, availing them&#383;elves of the &#383;tupor of one

that the new Convention might be entru&#383;ted with unlimited
powers. Not a thou&#383;andth portion of tho&#383;e who elected the
members, perhaps, comprehended the dreadful extent of &#383;uch a
demand, as ab&#383;urd as it has proved fatal.&mdash;<i>"Tout

<p>In all the&#383;e conflicts of party, the victory &#383;eems

Robe&#383;pierre, and his colleagues in the Committee of Public
Welfare, are now left inheritors of a power more de&#383;potic than
that exerci&#383;ed in Japan.&mdash;Robe&#383;pierre is certainly
not deficient in abilities, but they are not great in proportion to
the influence they have acquired him. They may, perhaps, be more
properly called &#383;ingular than great, and con&#383;i&#383;t in
the art of appropriating to his own advantage both the events of
chance and the labours of others, and of captivating the people by
an exterior of &#383;evere virtue, which a cold heart enable&#383;

&#383;trong pa&#383;&#383;ions, but of &#383;y&#383;tem, is

adver&#383;ity from other people. Here are many among&#383;t us who

which may repo&#383;e my hara&#383;&#383;ed faculties, and in which
mere comfort and &#383;ecurity are portrayed as luxuries. After

<h2>April 22, 1794.</h2>
<p>Our abode becomes daily more crouded; and I ob&#383;erve, that
the greater part of tho&#383;e now arre&#383;ted are farmers. This
appears &#383;trange enough, when we con&#383;ider how much the
revolutionary per&#383;ecution has hitherto &#383;pared this
cla&#383;s of people; and you will naturally enquire why it has at
length reached them.</p>
<p>It has been often ob&#383;erved, that the two extremes of
&#383;ociety are nearly the &#383;ame in all countries; the great
re&#383;emble each other from education, the little from nature.
Compari&#383;ons, therefore, of morals and manner&#383; &#383;hould
be drawn from the intervening cla&#383;&#383;es; yet from this
compari&#383;on al&#383;o I believe we mu&#383;t exclude farmers,
who are every where the &#383;ame, and who &#383;eem always more
marked by profe&#383;&#383;ional &#383;imilitude than national
di&#383;tinction.</p>
<p>The French farmer exhibits the &#383;ame acutene&#383;s in all
that regards his own intere&#383;t, and the &#383;ame
&#383;tupidity on mo&#383;t other occa&#383;ions, as the mere
Engli&#383;h one; and the &#383;ame objects which enlarge the
under&#383;tanding and dilate the heart of other people, &#383;eem
to have a contrary effect on both. They contemplate the objects of
nature as the &#383;tock-jobber does the vici&#383;&#383;itudes of
the public funds: "the dews of heaven," and the enlivening orb by
which they are di&#383;pelled, are to the farmer only objects of
avaricious &#383;peculation; and the &#383;carcity, which is
partially profitable, is but too often more welcome than a general
abundance.&mdash;They con&#383;ider nothing beyond the limits of
their own farms, except for the purpo&#383;e of making envious
compari&#383;ons with tho&#383;e of their neighbours; and being fed
and clothed almo&#383;t without intermediate commerce, they have
little nece&#383;&#383;ity for communication, and are nearly as
i&#383;olated a part of &#383;ociety as &#383;ailors
them&#383;elves.</p>
<p>The French revolutioni&#383;ts have not been unob&#383;erving of
the&#383;e circum&#383;tances, nor &#383;crupulous of profiting by
them: they knew they might have di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed for ever
their metaphy&#383;ical definitions of the rights of man, without
reaching the comprehen&#383;ion, or exciting the intere&#383;t, of
the country people; but that if they would not under&#383;tand the
propagation of the rights of man, they would very ea&#383;ily
comprehend an abolition of the rights of their landlords.
Accordingly, the fir&#383;t principle of liberty they were taught
from the new code was, that they had a right to a&#383;&#383;emble
in arms, to force the &#383;urrender of title-deeds; and their
fir&#383;t revolutionary notions of equality and property &#383;eem
to have been manife&#383;ted by the burning of chateaux, and
refu&#383;ing to pay their rents. They were permitted to intimidate
their landlords, in order to force them to emigration, and either
to &#383;ell their e&#383;tates at a low price, or leave them to
the mercy of the tenants.</p>
<p>At a time when the nece&#383;&#383;ities of the &#383;tate had
been great enough to be made the pretext of a dreadful revolution,
they were not only almo&#383;t exempt from contributing to its
relief, but were enriched by the common di&#383;tre&#383;s; and
while the re&#383;t of their countrymen beheld with unavailing
regret their property gradually replaced by &#383;craps of paper,
the pea&#383;ant&#383; became in&#383;olent and daring by impunity,
refu&#383;ed to &#383;ell but for &#383;pecie, and were daily
ama&#383;&#383;ing wealth. It is not therefore to be wondered at,
that they were partial to the new order of things. The pri&#383;ons
might have overflowed or been thinned by the mi&#383;eries of
tho&#383;e with whom they had been crowded&mdash;the Revolutionary
Tribunal might have &#383;acrificed half France, and the&#383;e
&#383;elfi&#383;h citizens, I fear, would have beheld it
tranquilly, had not the requi&#383;ition forced their labourers to
the army, and the "maximum" lowered the price of their corn. The
exigency of the war, and an internal &#383;carcity, having rendered
the&#383;e mea&#383;ures nece&#383;&#383;ary, and it being found
impo&#383;&#383;ible to per&#383;uade the farmers into a peaceful
compliance with them, the government has had recour&#383;e to its
u&#383;ual &#383;ummary mode of expo&#383;tulation&mdash;a
pri&#383;on or the Guillotine.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The avarice of the farmers was doubtle&#383;s to be
condemned, but the cruel de&#383;poti&#383;m of the government
almo&#383;t weakened our &#383;en&#383;e of rectitude; for by
confounding error with guilt, and guilt with innocence, they
habituated us to indi&#383;criminate pity, and obliged u&#383; to
tran&#383;fer our hatred of a crime to tho&#383;e who in
puni&#383;hing it, ob&#383;erved neither mercy nor ju&#383;tice. A
farmer was guillotined, becau&#383;e &#383;ome blades of corn
appeared growing in one of his ponds; from which circum&#383;tance
it was inferred, he had thrown in a large quantity, in order to
promote a &#383;carcity&mdash;though it wa&#383;
&#383;ub&#383;tantially proved on his trial, that at the preceding
harve&#383;t the grain of an adjoining field had been got in during
a high wind, and that in all probability &#383;ome &#383;cattered
ears which reached the water had produced what was deemed
&#383;ufficient te&#383;timony to convict him.&mdash; Another
underwent the &#383;ame puni&#383;hment for pur&#383;uing his
u&#383;ual cour&#383;e of tillage, and &#383;owing part of his
ground with lucerne, in&#383;tead of employing the whole for wheat;
and every where the&#383;e people became the objects of
per&#383;ecution, both in their per&#383;ons and property.
"Almo&#383;t all our con&#383;iderable farmers have been thrown
into pri&#383;on; the con&#383;equence is, that their capital is
eat up, their &#383;tock gone to ruin, and our lands have lo&#383;t
the almo&#383;t incalculable effect of their indu&#383;try. In La
Vendee &#383;ix million acres of land lie uncultivated, and five
hundred thou&#383;and oxen have been turned a&#383;tray, without
&#383;helter and without an owner." Speech of Dubois Crance, Sept.
22, 1794.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;Amazed to find them&#383;elves the objects of a tyranny
they had hitherto contributed to &#383;upport, and &#383;haring the
mi&#383;fortune of their Lords and Clergy, the&#383;e ignorant and

from comprehending or being &#383;ati&#383;fied with this new

attending the French through the whole revolution, that the
different cla&#383;&#383;es have too readily facilitated the
&#383;acrifice of each other; and the Nobility, the Clergy, the
Merchant, and the Farmer, have the mortification of experiencing,
that their &#383;elfi&#383;h and illiberal policy has an&#383;wered

<p>Angelique has contrived to-day to negotiate the &#383;ale of

almo&#383;t half their value for, though not without many
injunctions to &#383;ecre&#383;y, and as many implied panegyrics on
her benevolence, in ri&#383;king the odium of affording
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance to a foreigner. We are, I
a&#383;&#383;ure you, under the nece&#383;&#383;ity of being
oeconomi&#383;ts, where the mo&#383;t abundant wealth could not

clande&#383;tine di&#383;po&#383;al of my unnece&#383;&#383;ary
trinkets, is con&#383;iderably dimini&#383;hed,* by arbitrary
impo&#383;itions of the guard and the poor,** and a voluntary tax
from the mi&#383;ery that &#383;urrounds us.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I am aware of Mr. Burke's plea&#383;antry on the
expre&#383;&#383;ion of very little, being greatly dimini&#383;hed;
but my exchequer at this time wa&#383; as well calculated to prove
the infinite divi&#383;ibility of matter, a&#383; that of the Welch
principality. ** The guards of the republican Ba&#383;tilles were
paid by the pri&#383;oner&#383; they contained; and, in many
places, the tax for this purpo&#383;e wa&#383; levied with indecent
rigour. It might indeed be &#383;uppo&#383;ed, that people already
in pri&#383;on could have little to apprehend from an inability or
unwillingne&#383;s to &#383;ubmit to &#383;uch an impo&#383;ition;
yet tho&#383;e who refu&#383;ed were menaced with a dungeon; and I
was informed, from undoubted authority, of two in&#383;tances of
the &#383;ort among the Engli&#383;h&mdash;the one a young woman,
the other a per&#383;on with a large family of children, who were
on the point of &#383;uffering thi&#383; treatment, but that the
humanity of &#383;ome of their companion&#383; interfered and paid
the &#383;um exacted of them. The tax for &#383;upporting the
impri&#383;oned poor was more willingly complied with, though not
le&#383;s iniquitous in its principle; numbers of inoffen&#383;ive
and indu&#383;trious people were taken from their homes on account
of their religion, or other frivolous pretexts, and not having the
wherewithal to maintain them&#383;elves in confinement,
in&#383;tead of being kept by the republic, were &#383;upported by
their fellow-pri&#383;oners, in con&#383;equence of a decree to
that purpo&#383;e. Families who inherited nothing from their noble
ance&#383;tors but their names, were dragged from ob&#383;curity
only to become objects of per&#383;ecution; and one in particular,
con&#383;i&#383;ting of nine per&#383;ons, who lived in extreme
indigence, but were notwith&#383;tanding of the pro&#383;cribed
cla&#383;s; the &#383;ons were brought wounded from the army and
lodged with the father, mother, and five younger children in a
pri&#383;on, where they had &#383;carcely food to &#383;upport, or
clothing to cover them. I take this opportunity of doing
ju&#383;tice to the Comte d'Artois, who&#383;e youthful errors did
not extingui&#383;h his benevolence&mdash;the unfortunate people in
que&#383;tion having enjoyed a pen&#383;ion from him until the
revolution deprived them of it.</blockquote>

compatrioti&#383;m. They have told me, that when the decree for

happened to be on a vi&#383;it, a few miles from the town; and
having notice that a party of hor&#383;e were on the road to take
them, willing to gain time at lea&#383;t, they e&#383;caped by
another route, and got home. The republican con&#383;tables, for I
can call the military employed in the interior by no better
appellation, finding their prey had taken flight, adopted the
impartial ju&#383;tice of the men of Charles Town,* and carried off

<p>You would &#383;mile to &#383;ee with what anxious credulity
intelligence of thi&#383; &#383;ort is propagated: we &#383;top
each other on the &#383;tairs and li&#383;ten while our palled
dinner, ju&#383;t arrived from the traiteur, is cooling; and the
bucket of the draw-well hangs &#383;u&#383;pended while a
hi&#383;tory is fini&#383;hed, of which the relator knows as little
as the hearer, and which, after all, prove&#383; to have originated
in &#383;ome ambiguous phra&#383;e of our keeper, uttered in a
good-humoured paroxy&#383;m while receiving a douceur.</p>
<p>We occa&#383;ionally lo&#383;e &#383;ome of our
a&#383;&#383;ociates, who, having obtained their di&#383;charge,
<i>depart a la Francai&#383;e,</i> forget their &#383;uffering, and
prai&#383;e the clemency of Dumont, and the virtue of the
Convention; while tho&#383;e who remain &#383;till unconverted
amu&#383;e them&#383;elves in conjecturing the channel through
which &#383;uch favours were &#383;olicited, and alleging
rea&#383;ons why &#383;uch preferences were partial and
unju&#383;t.</p>
<p>Dumont vi&#383;its us, as u&#383;ual, receives an hundred or two
of petitions, which he does not deign to read, and re&#383;erves
his indulgence for tho&#383;e who have the means of
a&#383;&#383;ailing him through the &#383;miles of a favourite
mi&#383;tre&#383;s, or propitiating him by more
&#383;ub&#383;tantial advantages.&mdash;Many of the emigrant&#383;'
wives have procured their liberty by being divorced, and in this
there is nothing blameable, for I imagine the greater number
con&#383;ider it only as a temporary expedient, indifferent in
it&#383;elf, and which they are ju&#383;tified in having
recour&#383;e to for the protection of their per&#383;ons and
property. But the&#383;e dome&#383;tic alienations are not confined
to tho&#383;e who once moved in the higher orders of
&#383;ociety&mdash;the monthly regi&#383;ters announce almo&#383;t
as many divorces as marriages, and the facility of &#383;eparation
has rendered the one little more than a licentiou&#383; compact,
which the other is con&#383;idered as a means of
di&#383;&#383;olving. The effect of the revolution has in this, as
in many other ca&#383;es, been to make the little emulate the vices
of the great, and to introduce a more gro&#383;s and
de&#383;tructive policy among the people at large, than
exi&#383;ted in the narrow circle of courtiers, imitators of the
Regent, or Louis the fifteenth. Immorality, now con&#383;ecrated as
a principle, is far more pernicious than when, though
practi&#383;ed, it was condemned, and, though &#383;uffered, not
&#383;anctioned.</p>
<p>You mu&#383;t forgive me if I ennuye you a little
&#383;ententiou&#383;ly&mdash;I was more partial to the lower ranks
of life in France, than to tho&#383;e who were deemed their
&#383;uperiors; and I cannot help beholding with indignant regret
the la&#383;t a&#383;ylums of national morals thus invaded by the
general corruption.&mdash;I believe no one will di&#383;pute that
the revolution ha&#383; rendered the people more vicious; and,
without con&#383;idering the matter either in a moral or religious
point of view, it is impo&#383;&#383;ible to a&#383;&#383;ert that
they are not le&#383;s happy. How many times, when I was at
liberty, have I heard the old wi&#383;h for an acce&#383;&#383;ion
of years, or envy tho&#383;e yet too young to be &#383;en&#383;ible
of "the mi&#383;eries of a revolution!"&mdash;Were the vanity of
the &#383;elf-&#383;ufficient philo&#383;opher
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of remor&#383;e, would he not, when he
beholds this country, lament his pre&#383;umption, in
&#383;uppo&#383;ing he had a right to cancel the wi&#383;dom of
pa&#383;t ages; or that the happine&#383;s of mankind might be
promoted by the de&#383;truction of their morals, and the
depravation of their &#383;ocial affections?&mdash;Yours,

<h2>April 30, 1794.</h2>
<p>For &#383;ome years previous to the revolution, there were
&#383;everal points in which the French a&#383;cribed to
them&#383;elves a &#383;uperiority not very di&#383;tant from
perfection. Among&#383;t the&#383;e were philo&#383;ophy,
politene&#383;s, the refinements of &#383;ociety, and, above all,
the art of living.&mdash;I have &#383;ometimes, as you know, been
inclined to di&#383;pute the&#383;e claims; yet, if it be true that
in our &#383;ublunary career perfection is not &#383;tationary, and
that, having reached the apex of the pyramid on one &#383;ide, we
mu&#383;t nece&#383;&#383;arily de&#383;cend on the other, I might,
on this ground, allow &#383;uch preten&#383;ions to be more
rea&#383;onable than I then thought them. Whatever progre&#383;s
might have been attained in the&#383;e re&#383;pects, or however
near our neighbours might have approached to one extreme, it is but
too certain they are now rapidly declining to the other. This
boa&#383;ted philo&#383;ophy i&#383; become a horrid compound of
all that is offen&#383;ive to Heaven, and di&#383;graceful to
man&mdash;this politene&#383;s, a ferocious incivility&mdash;and
thi&#383; &#383;ocial elegance and exclu&#383;ive &#383;cience in
the enjoyment of life, are now reduced to &#383;u&#383;picious
intercour&#383;e, and the want of common nece&#383;&#383;aries.</p>
<p>If the national vanity only were wounded, perhaps I might
&#383;mile, though I hope I &#383;hould not triumph; but when I
&#383;ee &#383;o much mi&#383;ery accompany &#383;o profound a
degradation, my heart does not accord with my language, if I
&#383;eem to do either one or the other.</p>
<p>I &#383;hould ineffectually attempt to de&#383;cribe the
circum&#383;tances and &#383;ituation which have given ri&#383;e to
the&#383;e reflections. Imagine to your&#383;elf whatever tyranny
can inflict, or human nature &#383;ubmit to&mdash; whatever can be
the re&#383;ult of unre&#383;trained wickedne&#383;s and
unre&#383;i&#383;ting de&#383;pair&mdash;all that can &#383;courge
or di&#383;grace a people&mdash;and you may form &#383;ome idea of
the actual &#383;tate of this country: but do not &#383;earch your
book&#383; for compari&#383;ons, or expect to find in the
pro&#383;criptions and extravagancies of former periods any
examples by which to judge the pre&#383;ent.&mdash;Tiberius and
Nero are on the road to oblivion, and the &#383;ubject&#383; of the
Lama may boa&#383;t comparative preten&#383;ions to rank as a free
and enlightened nation.</p>
<p>The frantic ebullitions of the revolutionary government are now
as it were &#383;ub&#383;ided, and in&#383;tead of appearing the
temporary re&#383;ources of "de&#383;poti&#383;m in
di&#383;tre&#383;s," [Burke.] have a&#383;&#383;umed the form of a
permanent and regular &#383;y&#383;tem. The agitation
occa&#383;ioned by &#383;o many unexampled &#383;cenes is
&#383;ucceeded by an habitual terror, and this depre&#383;&#383;ing
&#383;entiment has &#383;o pervaded all ranks, that it would be
difficult to find an individual, however ob&#383;cure or
inoffen&#383;ive, who deems his property, or even his
exi&#383;tence, &#383;ecure only for a moment. The &#383;ound of a
bell or a knocker at the clo&#383;e of the evening is the
&#383;ignal of di&#383;may. The inhabitants of the hou&#383;e
regard each other with looks of fearful interrogation&mdash;all the
precautions hitherto taken appear in&#383;ufficient&mdash; every
one recollects &#383;omething yet to be &#383;ecreted&mdash;a
prayer-book, an unburied &#383;ilver &#383;poon, or a few
a&#383;&#383;ignats "a face royale," are ha&#383;tily
&#383;crambled together, and if the vi&#383;it prove nothing more
than an amicable domiciliary one, in &#383;earch of arms and corn,
it forms matter of congratulation for a week after. Yet &#383;uch
is the &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion of the people to a government they
abhor, that it is &#383;carcely thought requi&#383;ite now to
arre&#383;t any per&#383;on formally: tho&#383;e whom it is
intended to &#383;ecure often receive nothing more than a written
mandate* to betake them&#383;elve&#383; to a certain pri&#383;on,
and &#383;uch unplea&#383;ant rendezvous are attended with more
punctuality than the mo&#383;t ceremonious vi&#383;it, or the
mo&#383;t gallant a&#383;&#383;ignation.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The&#383;e re&#383;cripts were u&#383;ually couched
in the following terms:&mdash; "Citizen, you are de&#383;ired to
betake your&#383;elf immediately to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, (naming
the pri&#383;on,) under pain of being conveyed there by an armed
force in ca&#383;e of delay."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;A few nece&#383;&#383;aries are ha&#383;tily packed
together, the adieus are made, and, after a walk to their
pri&#383;on, they lay their beds down in the corner allotted,
ju&#383;t as if it were a thing of cour&#383;e.</p>
<p>It was a general ob&#383;ervation with travellers, that the
roads in France were &#383;olitary, and had rather the
de&#383;erted appearance of the route of a caravan, than of the
communications between different parts of a rich and populous
kingdom. This, however, is no longer true, and, as far as I can
learn, they are now &#383;ufficiently crowded&mdash;not, indeed, by
curiou&#383; itinerants, parties of plea&#383;ure, or commercial
indu&#383;try, but by Deputie&#383; of the Convention,* agents of
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence,** committee men, Jacobin
mi&#383;&#383;ionaries,*** troops po&#383;ting from places where
in&#383;urrection is ju&#383;t quelled to where it has ju&#383;t
begun, be&#383;ides the great and never-failing &#383;ource of
activity, that of conveying &#383;u&#383;pected people from their
home&#383; to pri&#383;on, and from one pri&#383;on to
another.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Every department was infe&#383;ted by one, two, or
more of the&#383;e &#383;trolling Deputies; and, it mu&#383;t be
confe&#383;&#383;ed, the con&#383;tant tendency of the people to
revolt in many places afforded them &#383;ufficient employment.
Sometimes they acted as legi&#383;lators, making laws on the
&#383;pot&mdash;&#383;ometimes, both as judges and
con&#383;table&#383;&mdash;or, if occa&#383;ion required, they
amu&#383;ed them&#383;elves in a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ting the
executioner.&mdash;The migrations of ob&#383;cure men, armed with
unlimited powers, and who&#383;e per&#383;ons were unknown, was a
&#383;trong temptation to impo&#383;ture, and in &#383;everal
places adventurers were detected a&#383;&#383;uming the character
of Deputies, for various purpo&#383;es of fraud and
depredation.&mdash;The following in&#383;tance may appear
ludicrous, but I &#383;hall be excu&#383;ed mentioning it, as it is
a fact on record, and conveys an idea of what the people
&#383;uppo&#383;ed a Deputy might do, con&#383;i&#383;tent with the
"dignity" of his executive functions. An itinerant of this
&#383;ort, who&#383;e object &#383;eems to have been no more than
to procure a daily maintenance, arriving hungry in a village,
entered the fir&#383;t farm-hou&#383;e that pre&#383;ented
it&#383;elf, and immediately put a pig in requi&#383;ition, ordered
it to be killed, and &#383;ome &#383;au&#383;age&#383; to be made,
with all &#383;peed. In the meanwhile our mock-legi&#383;lator, who
&#383;eems to have acted his part perfectly well, talked of
liberty, l'amour de la Patrie, of Pitt and the coale&#383;ced
tyrants, of arre&#383;ting &#383;u&#383;picious people and
rewarding patriots; &#383;o that the whole village thought
them&#383;elves highly fortunate in the pre&#383;ence of a Deputy
who did no wor&#383;e than harangue and put their pork in
requi&#383;iton.&mdash;Unfortunately, however, before the
repa&#383;t of &#383;au&#383;age&#383; could be prepared, a hue and
cry reached the place, that thi&#383; gracious Repre&#383;entant
was an impo&#383;tor! He was bereft of hi&#383; dignities, conveyed
to pri&#383;on, and afterwards tried by the Tribunal
Revolutionnaire at Paris; but his Coun&#383;el, by
in&#383;i&#383;ting on the mildne&#383;s with which he had "borne
his faculties," contrived to get his puni&#383;hment mitigated to a
&#383;hort impri&#383;onment.&mdash;Another &#383;uffered death on
a &#383;omewhat &#383;imilar account; or, as the &#383;entence
expre&#383;&#383;ed it, for degrading the character of a National
Repre&#383;entative.&mdash;Ju&#383;t Heaven! for degrading the
character of a National Repre&#383;entative!!! &mdash;and this too
after the return of Carrier from Nantes, and the publication of
Collot d'Herboi&#383;' ma&#383;&#383;acres at Lyon&#383;! **The
agents employed by government in the purcha&#383;e of
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence amounted, by official
confe&#383;&#383;ion, to ten thou&#383;and. In all part&#383; they
were to be &#383;een, rivalling each other, and creating
&#383;carcity and famine, by requi&#383;itions and exactions, which
they did not convert to the profit of the republic, but to their
own.&mdash;The&#383;e privileged locu&#383;ts, be&#383;ides what
they &#383;eized upon, occa&#383;ioned a total &#383;tagnation of
commerce, by laying embargoes on what they did not want; &#383;o
that it frequently occurred that an unfortunate trade&#383;man
might have half the articles in his &#383;hop under
requi&#383;ition for a month together, and &#383;ometimes under
different requi&#383;ition&#383; from deputies,
commi&#383;&#383;aries of war, and agents of
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, all at once; nor could any thing be
di&#383;po&#383;ed of till &#383;uch claims were
&#383;ati&#383;fied or relinqui&#383;hed. *** Jacobin
mi&#383;&#383;ionaries were &#383;ent from Paris, and other great
towns, to keep up the &#383;pirits of the people, to explain the
benefit&#383; of the revolution, (which, indeed, were not very
apparent,) and to maintain the connection between the provincial
and metropolitan &#383;ocieties.&mdash;I remember the Deputies on
mi&#383;&#383;ion at Perpignan writing to the Club at Paris for a
reinforcement of civic apo&#383;tles, <i>"pour evangeli&#383;er les
habitans et les mettre dans la voie de &#383;alut"</i>&mdash;("to
convert the inhabitants, and put them in the road to
&#383;alvation").</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;The&#383;e movements are almo&#383;t entirely confined to
the official traveller&#383; of the republic; for, be&#383;ides the
&#383;carcity of hor&#383;es, the increa&#383;e of expence, and the
diminution of means, few people are willing to incur the
&#383;u&#383;picion or hazard* attendant on quitting their homes,
and every po&#383;&#383;ible ob&#383;tacle is thrown in the way of
a too general intercour&#383;e between the inhabitants of large
towns.</p>

per&#383;ons he was to tran&#383;act it with, and whether the
journey was to be performed on hor&#383;eback or in a carriage, and

<h2>June 3, 1794.</h2>
<p>The individual &#383;ufferings of the French may perhaps yet
admit of increa&#383;e; but their humiliation as a people can go no
farther; and if it were not certain that the acts of the government
are congenial to it&#383; principles, one might &#383;uppo&#383;e
this tyranny rather a moral experiment on the extent of human
endurance, than a political &#383;y&#383;tem.</p>
<p>Either the vanity or cowardice of Robe&#383;pierre is
continually &#383;ugge&#383;ting to him plots for his
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination; and on pretexts, at once
ab&#383;urd and atrocious, a whole family, with near &#383;eventy
other innocent people a&#383; accomplices, have been &#383;entenced
to death by a formal decree of the convention.</p>
<p>One might be inclined to pity a people obliged to
&#383;uppre&#383;s their indignation on &#383;uch an event, but the
mind revolts when addre&#383;&#383;es are pre&#383;ented from all
quarters to congratulate this mon&#383;ter's pretended e&#383;cape,
and to &#383;olicit a farther &#383;acrifice of victims to his
revenge.&mdash; The a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins of Henry the
Fourth had all the benefit of the laws, and &#383;uffered only
after a legal condemnation; yet the unfortunate Cecilia Renaud,
though evidently in a &#383;tate of mental derangement, was hurried
to the &#383;caffold without a hearing, for the vague utterance of
a truth, to which every heart in France, not lo&#383;t to humanity,
mu&#383;t a&#383;&#383;ent. Brooding over the mi&#383;eries of her
country, till her imagination became heated and di&#383;ordered,
this young woman &#383;eems to have conceived &#383;ome
hopele&#383;s plan of redre&#383;s from expo&#383;tulation with
Robe&#383;pierre, whom &#383;he regarded as a principal in all the
evils &#383;he deplored. The difficulty of obtaining an audience of
him irritated her to make &#383;ome compari&#383;on between an
hereditary &#383;overeign and a republican de&#383;pot; and
&#383;he avowed, that, in de&#383;iring to &#383;ee
Robe&#383;pierre, &#383;he was actuated only by a curio&#383;ity to
"contemplate the features of a tyrant."&mdash;On being examined by
the Committee, &#383;he &#383;till per&#383;i&#383;ted that her
de&#383;ign was "&#383;eulement pour voir comment etoit fait un
tyrant;" and no in&#383;trument nor po&#383;&#383;ible means of
de&#383;truction was found upon her to ju&#383;tify a charge of any
thing more than the wild and enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic attachment to
royali&#383;m, which &#383;he did not attempt to
di&#383;gui&#383;e. The influence of a feminine propen&#383;ity,
which often &#383;urvives even the wreck of rea&#383;on and beauty,
had induced her to dre&#383;&#383; with peculiar neatne&#383;s,
when &#383;he went in &#383;earch of Robe&#383;pierre; and, from
the complexion of the times, &#383;uppo&#383;ing it very probable a
vi&#383;it of thi&#383; nature might end in impri&#383;onment and
death, &#383;he had al&#383;o provided her&#383;elf with a change
of clothes to wear in her la&#383;t moments.</p>
<p>Such an attention in a beautiful girl of eighteen was not very
unnatural; yet the mean and cruel wretches who were her judges, had
the littlene&#383;&#383; to endeavour at mortifying, by
dive&#383;ting her of her ornaments, and covering her with the
mo&#383;t loath&#383;ome rags. But a mind tortured to madne&#383;s
by the &#383;ufferings of her country, was not likely to be
&#383;haken by &#383;uch puerile malice; and, when interrogated
under this di&#383;gui&#383;e, &#383;he &#383;till pre&#383;erved
the &#383;ame firmne&#383;s, mingled with contempt, which &#383;he
had di&#383;played when fir&#383;t apprehended. No accu&#383;ation,
nor even implication, of any per&#383;on could be drawn from her,
and her only confe&#383;&#383;ion was that of a
pa&#383;&#383;ionate loyalty: yet an univer&#383;al con&#383;piracy
was neverthele&#383;&#383; decreed by the Convention to exi&#383;t,
and Mi&#383;s Renaud, with &#383;ixty-nine others,* were
&#383;entenced to the guillotine, without farther trial than merely
calling over their names.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It is worthy of remark, that the &#383;ixty-nine
people executed a&#383; accomplices of Mi&#383;s Renaud, except her
father, mother, and aunt, were totally unconnected with her, or
with each other, and had been collected from different
pri&#383;ons, between which no communication could have
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ted.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;They were conducted to the &#383;caffold in a &#383;ort
of red frocks, intended, as was alleged, to mark them as
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in&#383;&mdash;but, in reality, to
prevent the crowd from di&#383;tingui&#383;hing or receiving any
impre&#383;&#383;ion from the number of young and intere&#383;ting
females who were compri&#383;ed in this dreadful
&#383;laughter.&mdash;They met death with a courage which
&#383;eemed almo&#383;t to di&#383;appoint the malice of their
tyrants, who, in an original exce&#383;s of barbarity, are
&#383;aid to have lamented that their power of inflicting could not
reach tho&#383;e mental faculties which enabled their victims to
&#383;uffer with fortitude.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Fouquier Tinville, public accu&#383;er of the
Revolutionary Tribunal, enraged at the courage with which his
victims &#383;ubmitted to their fate, had formed the de&#383;ign of
having them bled previous to their execution; hoping by this means
to weaken their &#383;pirits, and that they might, by a
pu&#383;illanimous behaviour in their la&#383;t moments, appear
le&#383;s intere&#383;ting to the people.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Such are the horrors now common to almo&#383;t every part of
France: the pri&#383;ons are daily thinned by the ravages of the
executioner, and again repeopled by inhabitants de&#383;tined to
the fate of their predece&#383;&#383;ors. A gloomy re&#383;erve,
and a &#383;ort of uncertain foreboding, have taken
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of every body&mdash;no one ventures
to communicate his thoughts, even to hi&#383; neare&#383;t
friend&mdash;relations avoid each other&mdash;and the whole
&#383;ocial &#383;y&#383;tem &#383;eems on the point of being
di&#383;&#383;olved. Tho&#383;e who have yet pre&#383;erved their
freedom take the longe&#383;t circuit, rather than pa&#383;s a
republican Ba&#383;tille; or, if obliged by nece&#383;&#383;ity to
approach one, it is with downca&#383;t or averted looks, which
be&#383;peak their dread of incurring the &#383;u&#383;picion of
humanity.</p>
<p>I &#383;ay little of my own feelings; they are not of a nature
to be relieved by pathetic expre&#383;&#383;ions: "I am e'en
&#383;ick at heart." For &#383;ome time I have &#383;truggled both
again&#383;t my own evils, and the &#383;hare I take in the general
calamity, but my mortal part gives way, and I can no longer
re&#383;i&#383;t the de&#383;pondency which at times
depre&#383;&#383;es me, and which indeed, more than the danger
attending it, has occa&#383;ioned my abandoning my pen for the
la&#383;t month.&mdash;Several circum&#383;tances have occurred
within the&#383;e few days, to add to the unea&#383;ine&#383;s of
our &#383;ituation, and my own apprehen&#383;ions. Le Bon,*
who&#383;e cruelties at Arras &#383;eem to have endeared him to his
colleagues in the Convention, has had his powers extended to this
department, and Andre Dumont is recalled; &#383;o that we are
hourly menaced with the pre&#383;ence of a mon&#383;ter, compared
to whom our own repre&#383;entative is amiable.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I have already noticed the cruel and ferocious temper
of Le Bon, and the ma&#383;&#383;acres of his tribunals are already
well known. I will only add &#383;ome circum&#383;tances which not
only may be con&#383;idered a&#383; characteri&#383;tic of this
tyrant, but of the time&#383;&mdash;and I fear I may add of the
people, who &#383;uffered and even applauded them. They are
&#383;elected from many others not &#383;u&#383;ceptible of being
de&#383;cribed in language fit for an Engli&#383;h reader. As he
was one day enjoying his cu&#383;tomary amu&#383;ement of
&#383;uperintending an execution, where &#383;everal had already
&#383;uffered, one of the victim&#383; having, from a very natural
emotion, averted his eyes while he placed his body in the
po&#383;ture required, the executioner perceived it, and going to
the &#383;ack which contained the heads of tho&#383;e ju&#383;t
&#383;acrificed, took one out, and with the mo&#383;t horrible
imprecation&#383; obliged the unhappy wretch to ki&#383;s it: yet
Le Bon not only permitted, but &#383;anctioned this, by dining
daily with the hangman. He was afterwards reproached with this
familiarity in the Convention, but defended him&#383;elf by
&#383;aying, "A &#383;imilar act of Lequinio's was in&#383;erted by
your orders in the bulletin with 'honourable mention;' and your
decrees have invariably con&#383;ecrated the principles on which I
acted." They all felt for a moment the dominion of con&#383;cience,
and were &#383;ilent.&mdash;On another occa&#383;ion he
&#383;u&#383;pended an execution, while the &#383;avages he kept in
pay threw dirt on the pri&#383;oners, and even got on the
&#383;caffold and in&#383;ulted them previous to their
&#383;uffering. When any of his colleagues pa&#383;&#383;ed through
Arras, he always propo&#383;ed their joining with him in a
<i>"partie de Guillotine,"</i> and the executions were perpetrated
on a &#383;mall &#383;quare at Arras, rather than the great one,
that he, his wife, and relations might more commodiou&#383;ly enjoy
the &#383;pectacle from the balcony of the theatre, where they took
their coffee, attended by a band of mu&#383;ic, which played while
this human butchery la&#383;ted. The following circum&#383;tance,
though &#383;omething le&#383;s horrid, yet &#383;ufficiently
&#383;o to excite the indignation of feeling people, happened to
&#383;ome friends of my own.&mdash;They had been brought with many
others from a di&#383;tant town in open carts to Arras, and, worn
out with fatigue, were going to be depo&#383;ited in the
pri&#383;on to which they were de&#383;tined. At the moment of
their arrival &#383;everal per&#383;ons were on the point of being
executed. Le Bon, pre&#383;iding as u&#383;ual at the
&#383;pectacle, ob&#383;erved the cavalcade pa&#383;&#383;ing, and
ordered it to &#383;top, that the pri&#383;oners might
likewi&#383;e be witne&#383;&#383;es. He was, of cour&#383;e,
obeyed; and my terrified friends and their companions were obliged
not only to appear attentive to the &#383;cene before them, but to
join in the cry of <i>"Vive la Republique!"</i> at the
&#383;evering of each head.&mdash; One of them, a young lady, did
not recover the &#383;hock &#383;he received for months. The
Convention, the Committees, all France, were well acquainted with
the conduct of Le Bon. He him&#383;elf began to fear he might have
exceeded the limits of his commi&#383;&#383;ion; and, upon
communicating &#383;ome &#383;cruples of this kind to his
employers, received the following letters, which, though they do
not exculpate him, certainly render the Committee of Public Welfare
more criminal than him&#383;elf. "Citizen, "The Committee of Public
Welfare approve the mea&#383;ures you have adopted, at the
&#383;ame time that they judge the warrant you &#383;olicit

allowable, but enjoined by the very nature of your

tran&#383;mit you an order of the Committee, by which your powers
are extended to the neighbouring departments. Armed with &#383;uch

<h2>June 11, 1794.</h2>
<p>The immorality of Hebert, and the ba&#383;e compliances of the
Convention, for &#383;ome months turned the churches into "temples
of rea&#383;on."&mdash;The ambition, perhaps the vanity, of
Robe&#383;pierre, has now permitted them to be dedicated to the
"Supreme Being," and the people, under &#383;uch au&#383;pices, are
to be conducted from athei&#383;m to dei&#383;m. De&#383;irous of
di&#383;tingui&#383;hing his pre&#383;idency, and of exhibiting
him&#383;elf in a con&#383;picuous and intere&#383;ting light,
Robe&#383;pierre, on the la&#383;t decade, appeared as the hero of
a ceremony which we are told is to re&#383;tore morals,
de&#383;troy all the mi&#383;chiefs introduced by the abolition of
religion, and finally to defeat the machinations of Mr. Pitt. A gay
and &#383;plendid fe&#383;tival has been exhibited at Paris, and
imitated in the provinces: flags of the republican colours,
branches of trees, and wreaths of flowers, were ordered to be
&#383;u&#383;pended from the hou&#383;e&#383;&mdash;every
countenance was to wear the pre&#383;cribed &#383;mile, and the
whole country, forgetting the pre&#383;&#383;ure of &#383;orrow and
famine, was to rejoice. A &#383;ort of mon&#383;ter was prepared,
which, by &#383;ome unaccountable ingenuity, at once
repre&#383;ented Athei&#383;m and the Engli&#383;h, Cobourg and the
Au&#383;trian&#383;&mdash;in &#383;hort, all the enemies of the
Convention.&mdash;This external phantom, being burned with proper
form, di&#383;covered a &#383;tatue, which was under&#383;tood to
be that of Liberty, and the inauguration of this divinity, with
placing the bu&#383;ts of Chalier* and Marat in the temple of the
Supreme Being, by way of attendant &#383;aints, concluded the
ceremony.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Chalier had been &#383;ent from the municipality of
Paris after the dethronement of the King, to revolutionize the
people of Lyons, and to excite a ma&#383;&#383;acre. In
con&#383;equence, the fir&#383;t days of September pre&#383;ented
the &#383;ame &#383;cenes at Lyons as were pre&#383;ented in the
capital. For near a year he continued to &#383;courge this
unfortunate city, by urging the lower cla&#383;&#383;es of people
to murder and pillage; till, at the in&#383;urrection which took
place in the &#383;pring of 1793, he wa&#383; arre&#383;ted by the
in&#383;urgents, tried, and &#383;entenced to the guillotine.
&mdash;The Convention, however, who&#383;e calendar of &#383;aints
is a&#383; extraordinary as their criminal code, cho&#383;e to
beatify Chalier, while they executed Male&#383;herbes; and,
accordingly, decreed him a lodging in the Pantheon, pen&#383;ioning
his mi&#383;tre&#383;s, and &#383;et up hi&#383; bu&#383;t in their
own Hall as an a&#383;&#383;ociate for Brutus, whom, by the way,
one &#383;hould not have expected to find in &#383;uch
company.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The good citizens of the republic, not to be behind hand with
their repre&#383;entatives, placed Chalier in the cathedrals, in
their public-hou&#383;es, on fans and
&#383;nuff-boxe&#383;&mdash;in &#383;hort, wherever they thought
his appearance would proclaim their patrioti&#383;m.&mdash;I can
only exclaim a&#383; Poultier, a deputy, did, on a &#383;imilar
occa&#383;ion&mdash;"Francais, Francais, &#383;erez vous toujours
Francais?"&mdash;(Frenchmen, Frenchmen, will you never cea&#383;e
to be Frenchmen?)</p>
<p>&mdash;But the mandates for &#383;uch celebrations reach not the
heart: flower&#383; were gathered, and flags planted, with the
&#383;crupulous exactitude of fear;* yet all was cold and heavy,
and a di&#383;cerning government mu&#383;t have read in this
anxious and literal obedience the indication of terror and
hatred.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I have more than once had occa&#383;ion to remark the
&#383;ingularity of popular fe&#383;tivities &#383;olemnized on the
part of the people with no other intention but that of exact
obedience to the edicts of government. This is &#383;o generally
under&#383;tood, that Richard, a deputy on mi&#383;&#383;ion at
Lyons, writes to the Convention, as a circum&#383;tance
extraordinary, and worthy of remark, that, at the repeal of a
decree which was to have razed their city to the ground, a
rejoicing took place, <i>"dirigee et executee par le peuple, les
autorite&#383; con&#383;titutees n'ayant fait en quelque &#383;orte
qu'y a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ter,"</i>&mdash; (directed and executed by
the people, the con&#383;tituted authoritie&#383; having merely
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted at the ceremony).</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Even the pri&#383;ons were in&#383;ultingly decorated
with the mockery of colours, which, we are told, are the emblems of
freedom; and tho&#383;e who&#383;e relations have expired on the
&#383;caffold, or who are pining in dungeons for having heard a
ma&#383;s, were obliged to li&#383;ten with apparent admiration to
a di&#383;cour&#383;e on the charms of religious liberty.&mdash;The
people, who, for the mo&#383;t part, took little intere&#383;t in
the re&#383;t of this pantomime, and in&#383;en&#383;ible of the
national di&#383;grace it implied, beheld with &#383;tupid
&#383;ati&#383;faction* the in&#383;cription on the temple of
rea&#383;on replaced by a legend, &#383;ignifying that, in this age
of &#383;cience and information, the French find it
nece&#383;&#383;ary to declare their acknowledgment of a God, and
their belief in the immortality of the &#383;oul.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Much has been &#383;aid of the partial ignorance of
the unfortunate inhabitants of La Vendee, and divers republican
&#383;cribblers attribute their attachment to religion and monarchy
to that cau&#383;e: yet at Havre, a &#383;ea-port, where, from
commercial communication, I &#383;hould &#383;uppo&#383;e the
people as informed and civilized as in any other part of France,
the ears of piety and decency were a&#383;&#383;ailed, during the
celebration above-mentioned, by the acclamations of, <i>"Vive le
Pere Eternel!"&mdash;"Vive l'etre Supreme!"</i>&mdash;(I entreat
that I may not be &#383;u&#383;pected of levity when I
tran&#383;late this; in Engli&#383;h it would be "God Almighty for
ever! The Supreme Being for ever!")</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;At Avignon the public under&#383;tanding &#383;eems to
have been equally enlightened, if we may judge from the report of a
Paris mi&#383;&#383;ionary, who writes in the&#383;e
terms:&mdash;"The celebration in honour of the Supreme Being was
performed here ye&#383;terday with all po&#383;&#383;ible pomp: all
our country-folks were pre&#383;ent, and un&#383;peakably content
that there was &#383;till a God&mdash;What a fine decree (cried
they all) is thi&#383;!"</p>
<p>My la&#383;t letter was a record of the mo&#383;t odious
barbaritie&#383;&mdash;to-day I am de&#383;cribing a fe&#383;tival.
At one period I have to remark the de&#383;truction of the
&#383;aint&#383;&mdash;at another the adoration of Marat. One half
of the new&#383;paper is filled with a li&#383;t of names of the
guillotined, and the other with that of places of amu&#383;ement;
and every thing now more than ever mark&#383; that dete&#383;table
a&#383;&#383;ociation of cruelty and levity, of impiety and
ab&#383;urdity, which has uniformly characterized the French
revolution. It is become a crime to feel, and a mode to affect a
brutality incapable of feeling&mdash;the per&#383;ecution of
Chri&#383;tianity has made athei&#383;m a boa&#383;t, and the
danger of re&#383;pecting traditional virtues has hurried the weak
and timid into the apotheo&#383;is of the mo&#383;t abominable
vices. Con&#383;cious that they are no longer animated by
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m,* the Pari&#383;ians hope to imitate it by
&#383;avage fury or ferocious mirth&mdash;their patrioti&#383;m is
&#383;ignalized only by their zeal to de&#383;troy, and their
attachment to their government only by applauding its
cruelties.&mdash;If Robe&#383;pierre, St. Ju&#383;t, Collot
d'Herbois, and the Convention as their in&#383;truments,
de&#383;olate and ma&#383;&#383;acre half France, we may lament,
but we can &#383;carcely wonder at it. How &#383;hould a &#383;et
of ba&#383;e and needy adventurers refrain from an abu&#383;e of
power more unlimited than that of the mo&#383;t de&#383;potic
monarch; or how di&#383;tingui&#383;h the general abhorrence, amid
addre&#383;&#383;es of adulation, which Louis the Fourteenth would
have blu&#383;hed to appropriate?*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Louis the Fourteenth, aguerri (&#383;teeled) as he
was by &#383;ixty year&#383; of adulation and pro&#383;perity, had
yet mode&#383;ty &#383;ufficient to reject a "do&#383;e of
incen&#383;e which he thought too &#383;trong." (See
D'Alembert'&#383; Apology for Clermont Tonnerre.)
Republicani&#383;m, it &#383;hould &#383;eem, ha&#383; not

repre&#383;&#383;ed the zeal of the academicians, the Convention
publi&#383;h, without &#383;cruple, addre&#383;&#383;es more
hyperbolical than the prai&#383;es that monarch
refu&#383;ed.&mdash;Letters are addre&#383;&#383;ed to

the apo&#383;tle of one, and the tutelar deity of another. He is by
turns the repre&#383;entative of the virtue&#383; individually, and
a compendium of them altogether: and this mon&#383;ter, who&#383;e
features are the counterpart of his &#383;oul, find republican
para&#383;ites who congratulate them&#383;elves on re&#383;embling
him.</blockquote>

<p>The bulletins of the Convention announce, that the whole
republic is in a &#383;ort of revolutionary tran&#383;port at the
e&#383;cape of Robe&#383;pierre and hi&#383; colleague, Collot
d'Herbois, from a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination; and that we may
not &#383;uppo&#383;e the legi&#383;lators at large deficient in
&#383;en&#383;ibility, we learn al&#383;o that they not only
&#383;hed their grateful tears on this affecting occa&#383;ion, but
have &#383;ettled a pen&#383;ion on the man who was
in&#383;trumental in re&#383;cuing the benign Collot.</p>
<p>The members of the Committee are not, however, the
exclu&#383;ive objects of public adoration&mdash;the whole
Convention are at times incen&#383;ed in a &#383;tyle truly
oriental; and if this be &#383;ometimes done with more zeal than
judgment, it does not appear to be le&#383;s acceptable on that
account. A petition from an incarcerated poet a&#383;&#383;imilates
the mountain of the Jacobins to that of
Parna&#383;&#383;u&#383;&mdash;a &#383;tate-creditor importunes for
a &#383;mall payment from the Gods of Olympu&#383;&mdash;and
congratulations on the abolition of Chri&#383;tianity are offered
to the legi&#383;lators of Mount Sinai! Every in&#383;tance of
ba&#383;ene&#383;s calls forth an eulogium on their magnanimity. A
&#383;core of orators harangue them daily on their courage, while
they are over-awed by de&#383;pots as mean as them&#383;elves and
whom they continue to rein&#383;tal at the &#383;tated period with
clamorous approbation. They pro&#383;cribe, deva&#383;tate, burn,
and ma&#383;&#383;acre&mdash;and permit them&#383;elves to be
addre&#383;&#383;ed by the title of "Fathers of their Country!"</p>
<p>All this would be inexplicable, if we did not contemplate in the
French a nation where every faculty is ab&#383;orbed by a terror
which involves a thou&#383;and contradictions. The rich now
&#383;eek protection by becoming members of clubs,* and are happy
if, after various mortifications, they are finally admitted by the
mob who compo&#383;e them; while families, that heretofore piqued
them&#383;elves on a voluminous and illu&#383;trious genealogy,**
eagerly endeavour to prove they have no claim to either.</p>

<h2>Providence, Aug. 11, 1794.</h2>
<p>I have for &#383;ome days contemplated the fall of
Robe&#383;pierre and hi&#383; adherents, only as one of tho&#383;e
di&#383;pen&#383;ations of Providence, which were gradually to
pur&#383;ue all who had engaged in the French revolution. The late
change of parties has, however, taken a turn I did not expect; and,
contrary to what has hitherto occurred, there is a manife&#383;t
di&#383;po&#383;ition in the people to avail them&#383;elves of the
weakne&#383;s which is nece&#383;&#383;arily occa&#383;ioned by the
contentions of their governors.</p>
<p>When the news of this extraordinary event fir&#383;t became
public, it wa&#383; ever where received with great gravity&mdash;I
might &#383;ay, coldne&#383;s.&mdash;Not a comment was uttered, nor
a glance of approbation &#383;een. Things might be yet in
equilibrium, and popular commotions are always uncertain. Prudence
was, therefore, deemed, indi&#383;pen&#383;able; and, until the
conte&#383;t was finally decided, no one ventured to give an
opinion; and many, to be certain of guarding again&#383;t verbal
indi&#383;cretion, ab&#383;tained from all intercour&#383;e
whatever.</p>
<p>By degrees, the execution of Robe&#383;pierre and above an
hundred of hi&#383; partizans, convinced even the mo&#383;t timid;
the murmurs of &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed di&#383;content began to
be heard; and all thought they might now with &#383;afety relieve
their fears and their &#383;ufferings, by execrating the memory of
the departed tyrants. The pri&#383;ons, which had hitherto been
avoided a&#383; endangering all who approached them, were &#383;oon
vi&#383;ited with le&#383;&#383; apprehen&#383;ion; and
friend&#383;hip or affection, no longer exanimate by terror,
&#383;olicited, though &#383;till with trepidation, the
relea&#383;e of tho&#383;e for whom they were intere&#383;ted. Some
of our a&#383;&#383;ociates have already left us in
con&#383;equence of &#383;uch interce&#383;&#383;ions, and we all
hope that the tide of opinion, now avowedly inimical to the
dete&#383;table &#383;y&#383;tem to which we are victims, will
enforce a general liberation.&mdash;We are guarded but
&#383;lightly; and I think I perceive in the behaviour of the
Jacobin Commi&#383;&#383;arie&#383; &#383;omething of civility and
re&#383;pect not u&#383;ual.</p>
<p>Thus an event, which I beheld merely as the ju&#383;tice which
one &#383;et of banditti were made the in&#383;truments of
exerci&#383;ing upon another, may finally tend to introduce a more
humane &#383;y&#383;tem of government; or, at lea&#383;t,
&#383;u&#383;pend pro&#383;cription and ma&#383;&#383;acre, and
give this hara&#383;&#383;ed country a little repo&#383;e.</p>
<p>I am in arrears with my epi&#383;tolary chronicle, and the hope
of &#383;o de&#383;irable a change will now give me courage to
re&#383;ume it from the conclu&#383;ion of my la&#383;t. To-morrow
&#383;hall be dedicated to this purpo&#383;e.&mdash; Yours.</p>

given you &#383;ome faint &#383;ketch of the &#383;ituation of the

&#383;ay a faint &#383;ketch, becau&#383;e a thou&#383;and horrors
and iniquities, which are now daily di&#383;clo&#383;ing, were then
confined to the &#383;cenes where they were perpetrated; and we
knew little more of them than what we collected from the
report&#383; of the Convention, where they excited a laugh as
plea&#383;antries, or applau&#383;e as acts of patrioti&#383;m.</p>
<p>France had become one va&#383;t pri&#383;on, executions were
daily multiplied, and a minute and comprehen&#383;ive
oppre&#383;&#383;ion &#383;eemed to have placed the lives, liberty,
and fortune of all within the gra&#383;p of the &#383;ingle
Committee. De&#383;pair it&#383;elf was &#383;ubdued, and the
people were gradually &#383;inking into a gloomy and &#383;tupid
obedience.</p>

<p>On the twenty-&#383;econd of Prairial, (June 10,) a law,
con&#383;i&#383;ting of a variety of articles for the regulation of
the Revolutionary Tribunal, wa&#383; introduced to the convention
by Couthon, a member of the government; and, as u&#383;ual adopted
with very little previous di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion.&mdash;Though
there wa&#383; no clau&#383;e of this act but ought to have given
the alarm to humanity, "knocked at the heart, and bid it not be
quiet;" yet the whole appeared perfectly unexceptionable to the
A&#383;&#383;embly in general: till, on farther examination, they
found it contained an implied repeal of the law hitherto
ob&#383;erved, according to which, no repre&#383;entative could be
arre&#383;ted without a preliminary decree for that
purpo&#383;e.&mdash;This di&#383;covery awakened their
&#383;u&#383;picions, and the next day Bourdon de l'Oi&#383;e, a
man of un&#383;teady principles, (even as a revolutioni&#383;t,)
was &#383;pirited up to demand an explicit renunciation of any
power in the Committee to attack the legi&#383;lative inviolability
except in the accu&#383;tomed forms.&mdash;The clau&#383;e&#383;
which elected a jury of murderers, that bereft all but guilt of
hope, and offered no pro&#383;pect to innocence but death, were
pa&#383;&#383;ed with no other comment than the u&#383;ual one of
applau&#383;e.*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

pro&#383;cription and murder which might reach every individual in
France except them&#383;elves, but they even &#383;acrificed
numbers of their own body; and if, in&#383;tead of propo&#383;ing
an article affecting the whole Convention, the Committee had
demanded the head&#383; of as many Deputies as they had
occa&#383;ion for by name, I am per&#383;uaded they would have met
no re&#383;i&#383;tance.&mdash;This &#383;ingle example of
oppo&#383;ition only renders the convention &#383;till more an
object of abhorrence, becau&#383;e it marks that they could
&#383;ubdue their pu&#383;illanimity when their own &#383;afety was

imputation of bribery from the court, &#383;econded Bourdon's

in&#383;tantaneou&#383;ly.</p>
<p>This fir&#383;t and only in&#383;tance of oppo&#383;ition was
highly di&#383;plea&#383;ing to the Committee, and, on the
twenty-fourth, Robe&#383;pierre, Barrere, Couthon, and Billaud,
animadverted with &#383;uch &#383;everity on the promoters of it,
that the terrified Bourdon* declared, the repeal he had
&#383;olicited was unnece&#383;&#383;ary, and that he believed the
Committee were de&#383;tined to be the &#383;aviours of the
country; while Merlin de Douay di&#383;claimed all &#383;hare in
the bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383;&mdash; and, in fine, it was determined,
that the law of the twenty-&#383;econd of Prairial &#383;hould
remain as fir&#383;t pre&#383;ented to the Convention, and that the

<p>So dangerous an infringement on the privileges of the
repre&#383;entative body, dwelt on minds in&#383;en&#383;ible to
every other con&#383;ideration; the principal members caballed
&#383;ecretly on the perils by which they were &#383;urrounded; and
the &#383;ullen concord which now marked their deliberations, was
beheld by the Committee rather as the prelude to revolt, than the
indication of continued obedience. In the mean while it was openly
propo&#383;ed to concentrate &#383;till more the functions of
government. The circulation of new&#383;papers was in&#383;inuated
to be u&#383;ele&#383;s; and Robe&#383;pierre gave &#383;ome hints

under particular and official controul.*</p>

guillotined for publi&#383;hing the &#383;urrender of Landrecy
three days before it was announced officially.</blockquote>

<p>A rumour prevailed, that the refractory members who had excited
the late rebellion were to be &#383;acrificed, a general
purification of the A&#383;&#383;embly to take place, and that the
committee and a few &#383;elect adherents were to be inve&#383;ted
with the whole national authority. Li&#383;ts of pro&#383;cription
were &#383;aid to be made; and one of them was &#383;ecretly
communicated as having been found among the papers of a juryman of
the Revolutionary Tribunal lately arre&#383;ted.&mdash;The&#383;e
apprehen&#383;ions left the members implicated no alternative but
to anticipate ho&#383;tilities, or fall a &#383;acrifice; for they
knew the in&#383;tant of attack would be that of de&#383;truction,
and that the people were too indifferent to take any part in the
conte&#383;t.</p>
<p>Things were in this &#383;tate, when two circum&#383;tances of a
very different nature a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted in promoting the
final explo&#383;ion, which &#383;o much a&#383;toni&#383;hed, not
only the re&#383;t of Europe, but France it&#383;elf.</p>
<p>It is rare that a number of men, however well meaning, perfectly
agree in the exerci&#383;e of power; and the combinations of the
&#383;elfi&#383;h and wicked mu&#383;t be peculiarly &#383;ubject
to di&#383;cord and di&#383;&#383;olution. The Committee of Public
Welfare, while it en&#383;laved the convention and the people, was
torn by feuds, and undermined by the jealou&#383;ies of its
members. Robe&#383;pierre, Couthon, and St. Ju&#383;t, were
oppo&#383;ed by Collot and Billaud Varennes; while Barrere
endeavoured to deceive both parties; and Carnot, Lindet, the two
Prieurs, and St. Andre, laboured in the cau&#383;e of the common
tyranny, in the hope of &#383;till dividing it with the
conquerors.</p>
<p>For &#383;ome months this enmity was re&#383;trained, by the
nece&#383;&#383;ity of pre&#383;erving appearances, and
conciliated, by a general agreement in the principles of
admini&#383;tration, till Robe&#383;pierre, relying on his
&#383;uperior popularity, began to take an a&#383;cendant, which
alarmed &#383;uch of hi&#383; colleagues as were not his
parti&#383;ans, both for their power and their &#383;afety.
Animo&#383;ities daily increa&#383;ed, and their debates at length
became &#383;o violent and noi&#383;y, that it was found
nece&#383;&#383;ary to remove the bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383; of the
Committee to an upper room, le&#383;t people pa&#383;&#383;ing
under the window&#383; &#383;hould overhear the&#383;e
&#383;candalous &#383;cenes. Every means were taken to keep
the&#383;e di&#383;putes a profound &#383;ecret&mdash;the revilings
which accompanied their private conferences were turned into
&#383;mooth panegyrics of each other when they a&#383;cended the
tribune, and their unanimity was a favourite theme in all their
reports to the Convention.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* So late as on the &#383;eventh of Thermidor, (25th
July,) Barrere made a pompous eulogium on the virtues of
Robe&#383;pierre; and, in a long account of the &#383;tate of the
country, he acknowledges "&#383;ome little clouds hang over the
political horizon, but they will &#383;oon be di&#383;per&#383;ed,
by the union which &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ts in the
Committees;&mdash;above all, by a more &#383;peedy trial and
execution of revolutionary criminals." It is difficult to imagine
what new means of di&#383;patch this airy barbarian had contrived,
for in the &#383;ix weeks preceding this harangue, twelve hundred
and fifty had been guillotined in Paris only.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The impatience of Robe&#383;pierre to be relea&#383;ed from
a&#383;&#383;ociates who&#383;e view&#383; too much re&#383;embled
his own to leave him an undivided authority, at length overcame his
prudence; and, after ab&#383;enting him&#383;elf for &#383;ix weeks
from the Committee, on the 8th of Thermidor, (26th July,) he threw
off the ma&#383;k, and in a &#383;peech full of my&#383;tery and
implications, but containing no direct charges, proclaimed the
divi&#383;ions which exi&#383;ted in the government.&mdash;On the
&#383;ame evening he repeated this harangue at the Jacobins, while
St. Ju&#383;t, by his orders, menaced the obnoxious part of the
Committee with a formal denunciation to the Convention.&mdash;From
thi&#383; moment Billaud Varennes and Collot d'Herbois concluded
their de&#383;truction to be certain. In vain they &#383;oothed,
expo&#383;tulated with, and endeavoured to mollify St. Ju&#383;t,
&#383;o as to avert an open rupture. The latter, who probably knew
it was not Robe&#383;pierre's intention to accede to any
arrangement, left them to make his report.</p>
<p>On the morning of the ninth the Convention met, and with
internal dread and affected compo&#383;ure proceeded to their
ordinary bu&#383;ine&#383;s.&mdash;St. Ju&#383;t then a&#383;cended
the tribune, and the curio&#383;ity or indeci&#383;ion of the
greater number permitted him to expatiate at large on the intrigues
and guilt of every kind which he imputed to a "part" of the
Committee.&mdash;At the conclu&#383;ion of this &#383;peech,
Tallien, one of the devoted members, and Billaud Varennes, the
leader of the rival party, opened the trenches, by &#383;ome
&#383;evere remarks on the oration of St. Ju&#383;t, and the
conduct of tho&#383;e with whom he was leagued. This attack
encouraged others: the whole Convention joined in accu&#383;ing
Robe&#383;pierre of tyranny; and Barrere, who perceived the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s now deciding, ranged him&#383;elf on the
&#383;ide of the &#383;tronge&#383;t, though the remaining members
of the Committee &#383;till appeared to pre&#383;erve their
neutrality. Robe&#383;pierre was, for the fir&#383;t time,
refu&#383;ed a hearing, yet, the influence he &#383;o lately
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed &#383;till &#383;eemed to protect
him. The A&#383;&#383;embly launched decrees again&#383;t various
of hi&#383; &#383;ubordinate agents, without daring to proceed
again&#383;t him&#383;elf; and had not the indignant fury with
which he was &#383;eized, at the de&#383;ertion of tho&#383;e by
whom he had been mo&#383;t flattered, urged him to call for
arre&#383;t and death, it is probable the whole would have ended in
the puni&#383;hment of his enemies, and a greater
acce&#383;&#383;ion of power to him&#383;elf.</p>
<p>But at this cri&#383;is all Robe&#383;pierre's
circum&#383;pection abandoned him. Having provoked the decree for
arre&#383;ting his per&#383;on, in&#383;tead of &#383;ubmitting to
it until his party &#383;hould be able to rally, he
re&#383;i&#383;ted; and by &#383;o doing gave the Convention a
pretext for putting him out of the law; or, in other words, to
de&#383;troy him, without the delay or hazard of a previous
trial.</p>
<p>Having been re&#383;cued from the Gens d'Armes, and taken in
triumph to the municipality, the news &#383;pread, the Jacobins
a&#383;&#383;embled, and Henriot, the commander of the National
Guard, (who had likewi&#383;e been arre&#383;ted, and again
&#383;et at liberty by force,) all prepared to act in his defence.
But while they &#383;hould have &#383;ecured the Convention, they
employed them&#383;elve&#383; at the Hotel de Ville in
pa&#383;&#383;ing frivolous re&#383;olutions; and Henriot, with all
the cannoneers decidedly in his favour, exhibited an
u&#383;ele&#383;&#383; defiance, by &#383;talking before the
windows of the Committee of General Safety, when he &#383;hould
have been engaged in arre&#383;ting its members.</p>
<p>All the&#383;e imprudences gave the Convention time to proclaim
that Robe&#383;pierre, the municipality, and their adherents, were
decreed out of the protection of the laws, and in
circum&#383;tances of this nature &#383;uch a &#383;tep has
u&#383;ually been deci&#383;ive&mdash;for however odious a
government, if it does but &#383;eem to act on a pre&#383;umption
of its own &#383;trength, it has alway&#383; an advantage over its
enemies; and the timid, the doubtful, or indifferent, for the
mo&#383;t part, determine in favour of whatever wears the
appearance of e&#383;tabli&#383;hed authority. The people, indeed,
remained perfectly neuter; but the Jacobins, the Committees of the
Sections, and their dependents, might have compo&#383;ed a force
more than &#383;ufficient to oppo&#383;e the few guards which
&#383;urrounded the National Palace, had not the publication of
this &#383;ummary outlawry at once paralyzed all their hope&#383;
and efforts.&mdash;They had &#383;een multitudes hurried to the
Guillotine, becau&#383;e they were "hors de la loi;" and this
impre&#383;&#383;ion now operated &#383;o forcibly, that the
cannoneers, the national guard, and tho&#383;e who before were
mo&#383;t devoted to the cau&#383;e, laid down their arms, and
precipitately abandoned their chiefs to the fate which awaited
them. Robe&#383;pierre was taken at the Hotel de Ville, after being
&#383;everely wounded in the face; his brother broke his thigh, in
attempting to e&#383;cape from a window; Henriot wa&#383; dragged
from concealment, deprived of an eye; and Couthon, whom nature had
before rendered a cripple, now exhibited a mo&#383;t hideous
&#383;pectacle, from an ineffectual effort to &#383;hoot
him&#383;elf.&mdash;Their wounds were dre&#383;&#383;ed to prolong
their &#383;uffering, and their &#383;entence being contained in
the decree that outlawed them, their per&#383;ons were identified
by the &#383;ame tribunal which had been the in&#383;trument of
their crimes. &mdash;On the night of the tenth they were conveyed
to the &#383;caffold, amid&#383;t the in&#383;ults and execrations
of a mob, which a few hours before beheld them with trembling and
adoration.&mdash;Lebas, al&#383;o a member of the convention, and a
principal agent of Robe&#383;pierre, fell by his own hand; and
Couthon, St. Ju&#383;t, and &#383;eventeen others, &#383;uffered
with the two Robe&#383;pierres.&mdash;The municipality of Paris,
&amp;c. to the number of &#383;eventy-two, were guillotined the
&#383;ucceeding day, and about twelve more the day after.</p>
<p>The fate of the&#383;e men may be ranked as one of the mo&#383;t
dreadful of tho&#383;e examples which hi&#383;tory vainly
tran&#383;mits to di&#383;courage the pur&#383;uits of ambition.
The tyrant who peri&#383;hes amid&#383;t the impo&#383;ing
fallaciou&#383;ne&#383;s of military glory, mingles admiration with
abhorrence, and re&#383;cues hi&#383; memory from contempt, if not
from hatred. Even he who expiates hi&#383; crimes on the
&#383;caffold, if he die with fortitude, becomes the object of
involuntary compa&#383;&#383;ion, and the award of ju&#383;tice is
not often rendered more terrible by popular outrage. But the fall
of Robe&#383;pierre and hi&#383; accomplices was accompanied by
every circum&#383;tance that could add poignancy to &#383;uffering,
or dread to death. The ambitious &#383;pirit which had impelled
them to tyrannize over a &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive and
defencele&#383;s people, abandoned them in their la&#383;t moments.
Depre&#383;&#383;ed by angui&#383;h, exhau&#383;ted by fatigue, and
without courage, religion, or virtue, to &#383;upport them, they
were dragged through the &#383;avage multitude, wounded and
helple&#383;s, to receive that &#383;troke, from which even the
pious and the brave &#383;ometime&#383; &#383;hrink with
di&#383;may.</p>
<p>Robe&#383;pierre po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed neither the
talents nor merits of Nicolas Riezi; but they are both
con&#383;picuous in&#383;tances of the mutability of popular
&#383;upport, and there is a &#383;triking &#383;imilitude in the
la&#383;t events of their hi&#383;tory. They both degraded their
ambition by cowardice&mdash;they were both de&#383;erted by the
populace, whom they began by flattering, and ended by
oppre&#383;&#383;ing; and the death of both was painful and
ignominiou&#383;&mdash;borne without dignity, and embittered by
reproach and in&#383;ult.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Robe&#383;pierre lay for &#383;ome hours in one of
the committee-rooms, writhing with the pain of his wound, and
abandoned to de&#383;pair; while many of his colleagues, perhaps
tho&#383;e who had been the particular agents and applauders of his
crimes, pa&#383;&#383;ed and repa&#383;&#383;ed him, glorying and
je&#383;ting at his &#383;ufferings. The reader may compare the
death of Robe&#383;pierre with that of Rienzi; but if the people of
Rome revenged the tyranny of the Tribune, they were neither &#383;o
mean nor &#383;o ferocious as the Pari&#383;ians.</blockquote>

<p>You will perceive by this &#383;ummary that the overthrow of
Robe&#383;pierre wa&#383; chiefly occa&#383;ioned by the
rival&#383;hip of his colleagues in the Committee,
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted by the fears of the Convention at large for
them&#383;elves.&mdash;Another circum&#383;tance, at which I have
already hinted, as having &#383;ome &#383;hare in this event,

<h2>Providence, Aug. 13, 1794.</h2>
<p><i>Amour, tu perdis Troye</i> [Love! thou occa&#383;ioned&#383;t
the de&#383;truction of Troy.]:&mdash;yet, among the various
mi&#383;chiefs a&#383;cribed to the influence of this capricious
Sovereign, amid&#383;t the wrecks of &#383;ieges, and the
&#383;laughter of battles, perhaps we may not unju&#383;tly record
in his prai&#383;e, that he wa&#383; in&#383;trumental to the
&#383;olace of humanity, by contributing to the overthrow of
Robe&#383;pierre. It is at lea&#383;t plea&#383;ing to turn from
the general horror&#383; of the revolution, and &#383;uppo&#383;e,
for a moment, that the &#383;ocial affection&#383; were not yet
entirely bani&#383;hed, and that gallantry &#383;till retained
&#383;ome empire, when every other ve&#383;tige of civilization was
almo&#383;t annihilated.</p>
<p>After &#383;uch an exordium, I feel a little a&#383;hamed of my
hero, and could wi&#383;h, for the credit of my tale, it were not
more nece&#383;&#383;ary to invoke the hi&#383;toric mu&#383;e of
Fielding, than that of Homer or Ta&#383;&#383;o; but imperiou&#383;
Truth obliges me to confe&#383;s, that Tallien, who is to be the
&#383;ubject of this letter, was fir&#383;t introduced to celebrity
by circum&#383;tances not favourable for the comment of my poetical
text.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the revolution he was known only as an
eminent orator en plain vent; that is, as a preacher of
&#383;edition to the mob, whom he u&#383;ed to harangue with great
applau&#383;e at the Palais Royal. Having no profe&#383;&#383;ion
or means of &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, he, as Dr. John&#383;on
ob&#383;erves of one of our poets, nece&#383;&#383;arily became an
author. He was, however, no farther entitled to this appellation,
than as a periodical &#383;cribbler in the cau&#383;e of
in&#383;urrection; but in this he was &#383;o
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful, that it recommended him to the care of
Petion and the municipality, to whom his talents and principles
were &#383;o acceptable, that they made him Secretary to the
Committee.</p>
<p>On the &#383;econd and third of September 1792, he
&#383;uperintended the ma&#383;&#383;acre of the pri&#383;ons, and
is alledged to have paid the a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins
according to the number of victims they di&#383;patched with great
regularity; and he him&#383;elf &#383;eems to have little to
&#383;ay in his defence, except that he acted officially. Yet even
the imputation of &#383;uch a claim could not be overlooked by the
citizens of Paris; and at the election of the Convention he was
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by being cho&#383;en one of their
repre&#383;entatives.</p>
<p>It is needle&#383;s to de&#383;cribe his political career in the
A&#383;&#383;embly otherwi&#383;e than by adding, that when the
revolutionary furor was at its acme, he wa&#383; deemed by the
Committee of Public Welfare worthy of an important
mi&#383;&#383;ion in the South. The people of Bourdeaux were,
accordingly, for &#383;ome time hara&#383;&#383;ed by the
u&#383;ual effects of the&#383;e
vi&#383;itation&#383;&mdash;impri&#383;onments and the Guillotine;
and Tallien, though eclip&#383;ed by Maignet and Carrier, was by no
means deficient in the patriotic energies of the day.</p>
<p>I think I mu&#383;t before have mentioned to you a Madame de
Fontenay, the wife of an emigrant, whom I occa&#383;ionally
&#383;aw at Mad. de C____'s. I then remarked her for the uncommon
attraction of her features, and the elegance of her per&#383;on;
but was &#383;o much di&#383;gu&#383;ted at a tendency to
republicani&#383;m I ob&#383;erved in her, and which, in a young
woman, I thought unbecoming, that I did not promote the
acquaintance, and our different pur&#383;uits &#383;oon
&#383;eparated us entirely. Since this period I have learned, that
her conduct became exceedingly imprudent, or at lea&#383;t
&#383;u&#383;picious, and that at the general per&#383;ecution,
finding her republicani&#383;m would not protect her, &#383;he fled
to Bourdeaux, with the hope of being able to proceed to Spain.
Here, however, being a Spaniard by birth, and the wife of an
emigrant, &#383;he was arre&#383;ted and thrown into pri&#383;on,
where &#383;he remained till the arrival of Tallien on his
mi&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>The mi&#383;cellaneous occupations of a deputy-errant, naturally
include an introduction to the female pri&#383;oners; and Tallien's
pre&#383;ence afforded Mad. de Fontenay an occa&#383;ion of
pleading her cau&#383;e with all the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383; which
&#383;uch a pleader might, in other times, be &#383;uppo&#383;ed to
obtain from a judge of Tallien's age. The effect of the &#383;cenes
Tallien had been an actor in, was counteracted by youth, and his
heart was not yet indifferent to the charms of beauty&mdash;Mad. de
Fontenay was relea&#383;ed by the captivation of her liberator, and
a reciprocal attachment en&#383;ued.</p>
<p>We mu&#383;t not, however, conclude, all this merely a
bu&#383;ine&#383;s of romance. Mad. de Fontenay was rich, and had
connexions in Spain, which might hereafter procure an a&#383;ylum,
when a regicide may with difficulty find one: and on the part of
the lady, though Tallien's per&#383;on is agreeable, a de&#383;ire
of protecting her&#383;elf and her fortune might be allowed to have
&#383;ome influence.</p>
<p>From this time the revolutioni&#383;t is &#383;aid to have given
way: Bourdeaux became the Capua of Tallien; and its inhabitants
were, perhaps, indebted for a more moderate exerci&#383;e of his
power, to the &#383;miles of Mad. de Fontenay.&mdash;From hanging
loo&#383;e on &#383;ociety, he had now the pro&#383;pect of
marrying a wife with a large fortune; and Tallien very wi&#383;ely
con&#383;idered, that having &#383;omething at &#383;take, a
&#383;ort of comparative reputation among the higher cla&#383;s of
people at Bourdeaux, might be of more importance to him in future,
than all the applau&#383;e the Convention could be&#383;tow on a
liberal u&#383;e of the Guillotine.&mdash;The relaxed
&#383;y&#383;tem which was the con&#383;equence of &#383;uch
policy, &#383;oon reached the Committee of Public Welfare, to whom
it was highly di&#383;plea&#383;ing, and Tallien was recalled.</p>
<p>A youth of the name of Julien, particularly in the confidence of
Robe&#383;pierre, was then &#383;ent to Bourdeaux, not officially
as his &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;or, but as a &#383;py, to collect
information concerning him, as well as to watch the operations of
other mi&#383;&#383;ionaries, and prevent their imitating Tallien's
&#383;chemes of per&#383;onal advantage, at the expence of
&#383;candalizing the republic by an appearance of
lenity.&mdash;The di&#383;a&#383;trous &#383;tate of Lyons, the
per&#383;ecutions of Carrier, the conflagrations of Maignet, and
the crimes of various other Deputies, had obliterated the minor
revolutioni&#383;ms of Tallien:* The citizens of Bourdeaux
&#383;poke of him without horror, which in the&#383;e times was
equal to eulogium; and Julien tran&#383;mitted &#383;uch accounts
of his conduct to Robe&#383;pierre,** as were equally alarming to
the jealou&#383;y of his &#383;pirit, and repugnant to the cruelty
of his principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It was Tallien's boa&#383;t to have guillotined only
ari&#383;tocrats, and of this part of his merit I am willing to
leave him in po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion. At Toulon he was
charged with the puni&#383;hment of tho&#383;e who had given up the
town to the Engli&#383;h; but finding, as he alledged, nearly all
the inhabitants involved, he &#383;elected about two hundred of the
riche&#383;t, and that the horrid bu&#383;ine&#383;s might wear an
appearance of regularity, the patriots, that is, the mo&#383;t
notorious Jacobins, were ordered to give their opinion on the guilt
of the&#383;e victims, who were brought out into an open field for
that purpo&#383;e. With &#383;uch judges the &#383;entence was
&#383;oon pa&#383;&#383;ed, and a fu&#383;illade took place on the
&#383;pot.&mdash;It was on this occa&#383;ion that Tallien made
particular boa&#383;t of his humanity; and in the &#383;ame
publication where he relate&#383; the circum&#383;tance, he
expo&#383;es the "atrocious conduct" of the Engli&#383;h at the
&#383;urrender of Toulon. The cruelty of the&#383;e barbarians not
being &#383;ufficiently gratified by di&#383;patching the patriots
the &#383;horte&#383;t way, they hung up many of them by their
chins on hooks at the &#383;hambles, and left them to die at their
lei&#383;ure.&mdash;See "Mitraillades, Fu&#383;illades," a
recriminating pamphlet, addre&#383;&#383;ed by Tallien to Collot
d'Herbois.&mdash;The title alludes to Collot's exploit&#383; at
Lyons. ** It is not out of the u&#383;ual cour&#383;e of things
that Tallien'&#383; moderation at Bourdeaux might have been
profitable; and the wife or mi&#383;tre&#383;s of a Deputy was, on
&#383;uch occa&#383;ions, a u&#383;eful medium, through which the
grateful offerings of a rich and favoured ari&#383;tocrat might be
conveyed, without committing the legi&#383;lative
reputation.&mdash;The following pa&#383;&#383;age from Julien's
corre&#383;pondence with Robe&#383;pierre &#383;eems to allude to
&#383;ome little arrangements of thi&#383; nature: "I think it my
duty to tran&#383;mit you an extract from a letter of Tallien's,
[Which had been intercepted.] to the National Club.&mdash;It
coincides with the departure of La Fontenay, whom the Committee of
General Safety have doubtle&#383;s had arre&#383;ted. I find
&#383;ome very curious political details regarding her; and
Bourdeaux &#383;eems to have been, until this moment, a labyrinth
of intrigue and peculation."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears from Robe&#383;pierre's papers, that not only
Tallien, but Legendre, Bourdon de l'Oi&#383;e, Thuriot, and others,
were ince&#383;&#383;antly watched by the &#383;pies of the
Committee. The profe&#383;&#383;ion mu&#383;t have improved
wonderfully under the au&#383;pices of the republic, for I doubt if
<i>Mons. le Noir's Mouchard&#383;</i> [The &#383;pies of the old
police, &#383;o called in deri&#383;ion.&mdash; Bri&#383;&#383;ot,
in this act of accu&#383;ation, is de&#383;cribed as having been an
agent of the Police under the monarchy.&mdash;I cannot decide on
the certainty of this, or whether his occupation was immediately
that of a &#383;py, but I have re&#383;pectable authority for
&#383;aying, that antecedent to the revolution, hi&#383; character
was very &#383;lightly e&#383;timated, and him&#383;elf
con&#383;idered as "hanging loo&#383;e on &#383;ociety."] were as
able as Robe&#383;pierre's.&mdash;The reader may judge from the
following &#383;pecimens:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>"The 6th in&#383;tant, the deputy Thuriot, on quitting
the Convention, went to No. 35, Rue Jaques, &#383;ection of the
Pantheon, to the hou&#383;e of a pocket-book maker, where he
&#383;taid talking with a female about ten minutes. He then went to
No. 1220, Rue Fo&#383;&#383;e St. Bernard, &#383;ection of the
Sans-Culottes, and dined there at a quarter pa&#383;t two. At a
quarter pa&#383;t &#383;even he left the la&#383;t place, and
meeting a citizen on the Quay de l'Ecole, &#383;ection of the
Mu&#383;eum, near le Cafe Manoury, they went in there together, and
drank a bottle of beer. From thence he proceeded to la Mai&#383;on
Memblee de la Providence, No. 16, Rue d'Orleans Honore,
&#383;ection de la Halle au Bled, whence, after &#383;taying about
five-and-twenty minutes, he came out with a citoyenne, who had on a
puce Levite, a great bordered &#383;hawl of Japan cotton, and on
her head a white handkerchief, made to look like a cap. They went
together to No. 163, Place Egalite, where after &#383;topping an
in&#383;tant, they took a turn in the galleries, and then returned
to &#383;up.&mdash;They went in at half pa&#383;t nine, and were
&#383;till there at eleven o'clock, when we came away, not being
certain if they would come out again. "Bourdon de l'Oi&#383;e, on
entering the A&#383;&#383;embly, &#383;hook hands with four or five
Deputies. He was ob&#383;erved to gape while good news wa&#383;
announcing."</blockquote>

<p>Tallien was already popular among the Jacobins of Paris; and
hi&#383; connexion with a beautiful woman, who might enable him to
keep a dome&#383;tic e&#383;tabli&#383;hment, and to di&#383;play
any wealth he had acquired, without endangering his reputation, was
a circum&#383;tance not to be overlooked; for Robe&#383;pierre well
knew the efficacy of female intrigue, and dinners,* in gaining
partizans among the &#383;ubordinate members of the Convention.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Whoever reads attentively, and in detail, the debates
of the Convention, will ob&#383;erve the influence and envy created
by a &#383;uperior &#383;tyle of living in any particular member.
His dre&#383;s, hi&#383; lodging, or dinners, are a perpetual
&#383;ubject of malignant reproach. &mdash;This is not to be
wondered at, when we con&#383;ider the de&#383;cription of men the
Convention is compo&#383;ed of;&mdash;men who, never having been
accu&#383;tomed to the elegancies of life, behold with a grudging
eye the gay apparel or luxurious table of a colleague, who arrived
at Pari&#383; with no other trea&#383;ure but his patrioti&#383;m,
and has no o&#383;ten&#383;ible means beyond his eighteen livres a
day, now increa&#383;ed to thirty-&#383;ix.</blockquote>

<p>Mad. de Fontenay, was, therefore, on her arrival at Paris,
whither &#383;he had followed Tallien, (probably in order to
procure a divorce and marry him,) arre&#383;ted, and conveyed to
pri&#383;on.</p>
<p>An injury of this kind was not to be forgiven; and
Robe&#383;pierre &#383;eems to have acted on the pre&#383;umption
that it could not. He be&#383;et Tallien with &#383;pies, menaced
him in the Convention, and made Mad. de Fontenay an offer of
liberty, if &#383;he would produce a &#383;ub&#383;tantial charge
again&#383;t him, which he imagined her knowledge of his conduct at
Bourdeaux might furni&#383;h her grounds for doing. A refu&#383;al
mu&#383;t doubtle&#383;s have irritated the tyrant; and Tallien had
every rea&#383;on to fear &#383;he would &#383;oon be included in
one of the li&#383;ts of victims who were daily &#383;acrificed as
con&#383;pirators in the pri&#383;ons. He was him&#383;elf in
continual expectation of being arre&#383;ted; and it was generally
believed Robe&#383;pierre would &#383;oon openly accu&#383;e
him.&mdash;Thu&#383; &#383;ituated, he eagerly embraced the
opportunity which the &#383;chi&#383;m in the Committee
pre&#383;ented of attacking his adver&#383;ary, and we certainly
mu&#383;t allow him the merit of being the fir&#383;t who dared to
move for the arre&#383;t of Robe&#383;pierre.&mdash;I need not add,
that la belle was one of the fir&#383;t who&#383;e pri&#383;on
doors were opened; and I under&#383;tand that, being divorced from
Mons. de Fontenay, &#383;he is either married, or on the point of
being &#383;o, to Tallien.</p>
<p>This conclu&#383;ion &#383;poils my &#383;tory as a moral one;
and had I been the di&#383;po&#383;er of events, the
Septembri&#383;er, the regicide, and the cold
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in of the Toulonais, &#383;hould have
found other rewards than affluence, and a wife who might
repre&#383;ent one of Mahomet's Houris. Yet, &#383;urely, "the time
will come, though it come ne'er &#383;o &#383;lowly," when Heaven
&#383;hall &#383;eparate guilt from pro&#383;perity, and when
Tallien and his accomplices &#383;hall be remembered only as
monuments of eternal ju&#383;tice. For the lady, her faults are
amply puni&#383;hed in the di&#383;grace of &#383;uch an

<h2>Providence, Aug. 14, 1794.</h2>
<p>The thirty members whom Robe&#383;pierre intended to
&#383;acrifice, might perhap&#383; have formed &#383;ome
de&#383;ign of re&#383;i&#383;ting, but it appears evident that the
Convention in general acted without plan, union, or
confidence.*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The ba&#383;e and &#383;elfi&#383;h timidity of the
Convention is &#383;trongly evinced by their &#383;uffering fifty
innocent people to be guillotined on the very ninth of Thermidor,
for a pretended con&#383;piracy in the pri&#383;on of St.
Lazare.&mdash;A &#383;ingle word from any member might at thi&#383;
cri&#383;is have &#383;u&#383;pended the execution of the
&#383;entence, but that word no one had the courage or the humanity
to utter.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;Tallien and Billaud were rendered de&#383;perate by their
&#383;ituation, and it is likely that, when they ventured to attack
Robe&#383;pierre, they did not them&#383;elves expect to be
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful&mdash;it was the con&#383;ternation of
the latter which encouraged them to per&#383;i&#383;t, and the
A&#383;&#383;embly to &#383;upport them:</p>

</center>
<p>And to have been lucky enough to &#383;eize on this cri&#383;is,
is, doubtle&#383;s, the whole merit of the convention. There has,
it is true, been many allu&#383;ions to the dagger of Brutus, and
&#383;everal Deputies are &#383;aid to have conceived very heroic
projects for the de&#383;truction of the tyrant; but a&#383; he was
dead before the&#383;e projects were brought to light, we cannot
ju&#383;tly a&#383;cribe any effect to them.</p>
<p>The remains of the Bri&#383;&#383;otin faction, &#383;till at
liberty, from whom &#383;ome exertions might have been expected,
were cautiou&#383;ly inactive; and tho&#383;e who had been
mo&#383;t in the habit of appreciating them&#383;elves for their
valour, were now con&#383;picuous only for that di&#383;cretion
which Fal&#383;taff calls the better part of it.&mdash;Dubois
Crance, who had been at the expence of buying a Spani&#383;h
poniard at St. Malo, for the purpo&#383;e of
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inating Robe&#383;pierre, &#383;eems to
have been calmed by the journey, and to have finally recovered his
temper, before he reached the Convention.&mdash;Merlin de
Thionville, Merlin de Douay, and others of equal note, were among
the "pa&#383;&#383;ive valiant;" and Bourdon de l'Oi&#383;e had
already experienced &#383;uch di&#383;a&#383;trous effects from
incon&#383;iderate exhibitions of courage, that he now
re&#383;trained his ardour till the victory &#383;hould be
determined. Even Legendre, who is occa&#383;ionally the Brutus, the
Curtius, and all the patriots who&#383;e names he has been able to
learn, confined his prowe&#383;s to an a&#383;&#383;ault on the
club-room of the Jacobins, when it was empty, and carrying off the
key, which no one di&#383;puted with him, &#383;o that he can at
mo&#383;t claim an ovation. It is, in &#383;hort, remarkable, that
all the member&#383; who at pre&#383;ent affect to be mo&#383;t
vehement again&#383;t Robe&#383;pierre'&#383; principles, [And
where was the all-politic Sieyes?&mdash;At home, writing hi&#383;
own eulogium.] were the lea&#383;t active in attacking his
per&#383;on; and it i&#383; indi&#383;putable, that to Tallien,
Billaud, Louchet, Elie Laco&#383;te, Collot d'Herbois, and a few of
the more violent Jacobins, were due tho&#383;e fir&#383;t efforts
which determined his fall.&mdash;Had Robe&#383;pierre, in&#383;tead
of a querelous harangue, addre&#383;&#383;ed the convention in his
u&#383;ual tone of authority, and ended by moving for a decree
again&#383;t a few only of tho&#383;e obnoxious to him, the
re&#383;t might have been glad to compound for their own
&#383;afety, by abandoning a cau&#383;e no longer per&#383;onal:
but his impolicy, not his wickedne&#383;s, ha&#383;tened his fate;
and it is &#383;o far fortunate for France, that it has at
lea&#383;t &#383;u&#383;pended the &#383;y&#383;tem of government
which is a&#383;cribed to him.</p>
<p>The fir&#383;t days of victory were pa&#383;&#383;ed in
receiving congratulations, and taking precautions; and though men
do not often adapt their claims to their merits, yet the members of
the Convention &#383;eemed in general to be con&#383;cious that
none among&#383;t them had very decided preten&#383;ions to the
&#383;poils of the vanqui&#383;hed.&mdash;Of twelve, which
originally compo&#383;ed the Committee of Public Welfare,
&#383;even only remained; yet no one ventured to &#383;ugge&#383;t
a completion of the number, till Barrere, after previou&#383;ly
in&#383;inuating how adequate he and his colleagues were to the
ta&#383;k of "&#383;aving the country," propo&#383;ed, in his
flippant way, and merely as a matter of form, that certain
per&#383;ons whom he recommended, &#383;hould fill up the vacancies
in the government.</p>
<p>This mode&#383;t Carmagnole* was received with great
coolne&#383;s; the late implicit acquie&#383;cence was changed to
demur, and an adjournment unanimou&#383;ly called for.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* A ludicrous appellation, which Barrere u&#383;ed to
give to his report&#383; in the pre&#383;ence of tho&#383;e who
were in the &#383;ecret of his Charlatanry. The air of "La
Carmagnole" was originally compo&#383;ed when the town of that name
was taken by Prince Eugene, and was adapted to the indecent words
now &#383;ung by the French after the 10th of Augu&#383;t
1792.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Such unu&#383;ual temerity &#383;u&#383;pri&#383;ed and
alarmed the remains of the Committee, and Billaud Varennes
&#383;ternly reminded the Convention of the abject &#383;tate they
were &#383;o lately relea&#383;ed from. This produced retort and
replication, and the partners of Robe&#383;pierre's enormities, who
had hoped to be the tranquil inheritors of his power, found, that
in de&#383;troying a rival, they had rai&#383;ed them&#383;elves
ma&#383;ters.</p>
<p>The A&#383;&#383;embly per&#383;i&#383;ted in not adopting the
members offered to be impo&#383;ed upon them; but, as it was
ea&#383;ier to reject than to choo&#383;e, the Committee were
ordered to pre&#383;ent a new plan for this part of the executive
branch, and the election of tho&#383;e to be entru&#383;ted with it
was po&#383;tponed for farther con&#383;ideration.</p>
<p>Having now felt their &#383;trength, they next proceeded to
renew a part of the committee of General Safety, &#383;everal of
its members being inculpated as partizans of Robe&#383;pierre, and
though this Committee had become entirely &#383;ubordinate to that
of Public Welfare, yet its functions were too important for it to
be neglected, more e&#383;pecially as they compri&#383;ed a very
favourite branch of the republican government, that of
i&#383;&#383;uing writ&#383; of arre&#383;t at
plea&#383;ure.&mdash;The law of the twenty-&#383;econd of Prairial
is al&#383;o repealed, but the Revolutionary Tribunal is
pre&#383;erved, and the nece&#383;&#383;ity of &#383;u&#383;pending
the old jury, as being the creatures of Robe&#383;pierre, ha&#383;
not prevented the tender &#383;olicitude of the Convention for a
renovated activity in the e&#383;tabli&#383;hment it&#383;elf.</p>
<p>This a&#383;&#383;umption of power has become every day more
confirmed, and the addre&#383;&#383;es which are received by the
A&#383;&#383;embly, though yet in a &#383;train of gro&#383;s
adulation,* expre&#383;s &#383;uch an abhorrence of the late
&#383;y&#383;tem, as mu&#383;t &#383;uffice to convince them the
people are not di&#383;po&#383;ed to &#383;ee &#383;uch a
&#383;y&#383;tem continued.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* A collection of addre&#383;&#383;es, pre&#383;ented
to the Convention at variou&#383; periods, might form a curious
hi&#383;tory of the progre&#383;s of de&#383;poti&#383;m.
The&#383;e effu&#383;ions of zeal were not, however, all in the
"&#383;ublime" &#383;tyle: the legi&#383;lative dignity
&#383;ometimes conde&#383;cended to unbend it&#383;elf, and
li&#383;ten to metrical compo&#383;itions, enlivened by the
accompaniment of fiddles; but the manly and ferocious Danton, to
whom &#383;uch &#383;prightly interruptions were not congenial,
propo&#383;ed a decree, that the citizens &#383;hould, in future,
expre&#383;s their adorations in plain pro&#383;e, and without any
mu&#383;ical acce&#383;&#383;ories.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Billaud Varennes, Collot, and other members of the old
Committee, view the&#383;e innovations with &#383;ullen
acquie&#383;cence; but Barrere, who&#383;e frivolou&#383; and
facile &#383;pirit is incapable of con&#383;i&#383;tency, even in
wickedne&#383;s, per&#383;everes and flouri&#383;hes at the tribune
as gaily as ever.&mdash;Unaba&#383;hed by detection,
in&#383;en&#383;ible to contempt, he details his epigrams and
antithe&#383;e&#383; again&#383;t Catilines and Cromwells with as
much &#383;elf-&#383;ufficiency as when, in the &#383;ame
tin&#383;el eloquence, he promulgated the murderous edicts of
Robe&#383;pierre.</p>
<p>Many of the pri&#383;oners at Paris continue daily to obtain
their relea&#383;e, and, by the exertions of his per&#383;onal
enemies, particularly of our quondam &#383;overeign, Andre Dumont,
(now a member of the Committee of General Safety,) an examination
into the atrocities committed by Le Bon is decreed.&mdash;But,
amid&#383;t the&#383;e appearances of ju&#383;tice, a
ver&#383;atility of principle, or rather an evident tendency to the
decried &#383;y&#383;tem, i&#383; perceptible. Upon the
&#383;lighte&#383;t allu&#383;ion to the revolutionary government,
the whole Convention ri&#383;e in a ma&#383;s to vociferate their
adherence to it:* the tribunal, which was its off&#383;pring and
&#383;upport, i&#383; anxiou&#383;ly rein&#383;talled; and the low
in&#383;olence with which Barrere announce&#383; their victories in
the Netherlands, is, as u&#383;ual, loudly applauded.</p>

<p>The brothers of Cecile Renaud, who were &#383;ent for by
Robe&#383;pierre from the army to Paris, in order to follow her to
the &#383;caffold, did not arrive until their per&#383;ecutor was
no more, and a change of government wa&#383; avowed. They have
pre&#383;ented them&#383;elves at the bar of the Convention, to
entreat a revi&#383;al of their father's &#383;entence, and
&#383;ome compen&#383;ation for his property, &#383;o unju&#383;tly
confi&#383;cated.&mdash;You will, perhaps, imagine, that, at the
name of the&#383;e unfortunate young men, every heart anticipated a
con&#383;ent to their claims, even before the mind could examine
the ju&#383;tice of them, and that one of tho&#383;e bur&#383;ts of
&#383;en&#383;ibility for which thi&#383; legi&#383;lature is
&#383;o remarkable in&#383;tantaneou&#383;ly accorded the petition.
Ala&#383;! this was not an occa&#383;ion to excite the
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m of the Convention: Coupilleau de Fontenay, one
of the "mild and moderate party", repul&#383;ed the petitioners
with har&#383;hne&#383;s, and their claim was &#383;ilenced by a
call for the order of the day. The poor Renauds were afterwards
coldly referred to the Committee of Relief, for a pittance, by way
of charity, in&#383;tead of the property they have a right to, and
which they have been deprived of, by the ba&#383;e compliance of
the Convention with the caprice of a mon&#383;ter.</p>
<p>Such relap&#383;es and aberrations are not con&#383;olatory, but
the times and circum&#383;tances &#383;eem to oppo&#383;e
them&mdash;the whole fabric of de&#383;poti&#383;m i&#383;
&#383;haken, and we have rea&#383;on to hope the efforts of tyranny
will be counteracted by its weakne&#383;s.</p>
<p>We do not yet derive any advantage from the early maturity of
the harve&#383;t, and it is &#383;till with difficulty we obtain a
limited portion of bad bread. Severe decrees are enacted to defeat
the avarice of the farmers, and prevent monopolies of the new corn;
but the&#383;e people are invulnerable: they have already been at
i&#383;&#383;ue with the &#383;y&#383;tem of terror&mdash; and it
was found nece&#383;&#383;ary, even before the death of

ri&#383;k the de&#383;truction of the harve&#383;t for want of
hands to get it in. It is now di&#383;covered, that natural
cau&#383;es, and the &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s of individuals, are
adequate to the creation of a temporary &#383;carcity; yet when
this happened under the King, it was alway&#383; a&#383;cribed to
the machinations of government.&mdash;How have the people been
deceived, irritated, and driven to rebellion, by a degree of want,
le&#383;s, much le&#383;s, in&#383;upportable than that they are
obliged to &#383;uffer at pre&#383;ent, without daring even to
complain!</p>
<p>I have now been in confinement almo&#383;t twelve months, and my
health i&#383; con&#383;iderably impaired. The weather is
oppre&#383;&#383;ively warm, and we have no &#383;hade in the
garden but under a mulberry-tree, which is &#383;o &#383;urrounded
by filth, that it is not approachable. I am, however, told, that in
a few days, on account of my indi&#383;po&#383;ition, I &#383;hall
be permitted to go home, though with a provi&#383;o of being
guarded at my own expence.&mdash;My friends are &#383;till at
Arras; and if this indulgence be extended to Mad. de la F____,
&#383;he will accompany me. Per&#383;onal accommodation, and an
opportunity of re&#383;toring my health, render this
de&#383;irable; but I a&#383;&#383;ociate no idea of freedom with
my re&#383;idence in this country. The boundary may be extended,
but it is &#383;till a pri&#383;on.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Providence, Aug. 15, 1794.</h2>
<p>To-morrow I expect to quit this place, and have been wandering
over it for the la&#383;t time. You will imagine I can have no
attachment to it: yet a retro&#383;pect of my &#383;en&#383;ations
when I fir&#383;t arrived, of all I have experienced, and
&#383;till more of what I have apprehended &#383;ince that period,
makes me look forward to my departure with a &#383;ati&#383;faction
that I might almo&#383;t call melancholy. This cell, where I have
&#383;hivered through the winter&mdash;the long pa&#383;&#383;ages,
which I have &#383;o often traver&#383;ed in bitter
rumination&mdash;the garden, where I have painfully breathed a
purer air, at the ri&#383;k of &#383;inking beneath the fervid rays
of an unmitigated &#383;un, are not &#383;cenes to excite regret;
but when I think that I am &#383;till &#383;ubject to the tyranny
which has &#383;o long condemned me to them, this reflection, with
a &#383;entiment perhaps of national pride, which is wounded by
accepting as a favour what I have been unju&#383;tly deprived of,
renders me compo&#383;ed, if not indifferent, at the pro&#383;pect
of my relea&#383;e.</p>
<p>This dreary epoch of my life has not been without its
alleviations. I have found a chearful companion in Mad. de M____,
who, at &#383;ixty, wa&#383; brought here, becau&#383;e &#383;he
happened to be the daughter of Count L____, who has been dead
the&#383;e thirty year&#383;!&mdash;The graces and &#383;ilver
accents of Madame de B____, might have a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted in
beguiling &#383;everer captivity; and the Counte&#383;s de C____,
and her charming daughters (the elde&#383;t of whom i&#383; not to
be de&#383;cribed in the common place of panegyric), who, though
they have borne their own afflictions with dignity, have been
&#383;en&#383;ible to the mi&#383;fortunes of others, and whom I
mu&#383;t, in ju&#383;tice, except from all the imputations of
meanne&#383;s or levity, which I have &#383;ometimes had
occa&#383;ion to notice in tho&#383;e who, like them&#383;elves,
were objects of republican per&#383;ecution, have
e&#383;&#383;entially contributed to dimini&#383;h the horrors of
confinement.&mdash;I reckon it likewi&#383;e among my
&#383;ati&#383;factions, that, with the exception of the Marechalle
de Biron,* and General O'Moran, none of our fellow-pri&#383;oners
have &#383;uffered on the &#383;caffold.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The Marechalle de Biron, a very old and infirm woman,
was taken from hence to the Luxembourg at Paris, where her
daughter-in-law, the Duche&#383;s, was al&#383;o confined. A cart
arriving at that pri&#383;on to convey a number of victims to the
tribunal, the li&#383;t, in the coar&#383;e dialect of
republicani&#383;m, contained the name of la femme Biron. "But
there are two of them," &#383;aid the keeper. "Then bring them
both."&mdash; The aged Marechalle, who was at &#383;upper,
fini&#383;hed her meal while the re&#383;t were preparing, then
took up her book of devotion, and departed chearfully.&mdash;The
next day both mother and daughter were guillotined.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Dumont has, indeed, virtually occa&#383;ioned the death
of &#383;everal; in particular the Duc du Chatelet, the Comte de
Bethune, Mons. de Mancheville, &amp;c.&mdash;and it is no merit in
him that Mr. Luttrell, with a poor nun of the name of Pitt,* whom
he took from hence to Paris, as a capture which might give him
importance, were not ma&#383;&#383;acred either by the mob or the
tribunal.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This poor woman, who&#383;e intellects, as I am
informed, appeared in a &#383;tate of derangement, was taken from a
convent at Abbeville, and brought to the Providence, as a relation
of Mr. Pitt, though I believe &#383;he has no preten&#383;ions to
that honour. But the name of Pitt gave her importance; &#383;he was
&#383;ent to Paris under a military e&#383;cort, and Dumont
announced the arrival of this mi&#383;erable victim with all the
airs of a conqueror. I have been &#383;ince told, &#383;he was
lodged at St. Pelagie, where &#383;he &#383;uffered innumerable
hard&#383;hips, and did not recover her liberty for many months
after the fall of Robe&#383;pierre.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;If the per&#383;ecution of this department has not been
&#383;anguinary,* it &#383;hould be remembered, that it has been
covered with pri&#383;ons; and that the extreme
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion of its inhabitants would &#383;carcely
have furni&#383;hed the mo&#383;t mercile&#383;s tyrant with a
pretext for a &#383;everer regimen.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* There were &#383;ome prie&#383;ts guillotined at
Amiens, but the circum&#383;tance was concealed from me for
&#383;ome months after it happened.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Dumont, I know, expects to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a
reputation by not having guillotined as an amu&#383;ement, and
hopes that he may here find a retreat when his revolutionary
labours &#383;hall be fini&#383;hed.</p>
<p>The Convention have not yet cho&#383;en the members who are to
form the new Committee. They were ye&#383;terday &#383;olemnly
employed in receiving the American Amba&#383;&#383;ador;
likewi&#383;e a bra&#383;s medal of the tyrant Louis the
Fourteenth, and &#383;ome marvellous information about the
unfortunate Prince&#383;&#383;' having dre&#383;&#383;ed
her&#383;elf in mourning at the death of Robe&#383;pierre.
The&#383;e legi&#383;lators remind me of one of Swift's female
attendants, who, in &#383;pite of the literary ta&#383;te he
endeavoured to in&#383;pire her with, never could be dive&#383;ted
of her original hou&#383;ewifely propen&#383;ities, but would quit
the mo&#383;t curious anecdote, as he expre&#383;&#383;es it, "to
go &#383;eek an old rag in a clo&#383;et." Their projects for the
revival of their navy &#383;eldom go farther than a
tran&#383;po&#383;al in the &#383;tripes of the flag, and their
vengeance again&#383;t regal anthropophagi, and proud
i&#383;landers, is infallibly diverted by a denunciation of an
ari&#383;tocratic quartrain, or &#383;ome new mode, who&#383;e
general adoption renders it &#383;u&#383;pected as the badge of a
party.&mdash;If, according to Cardinal de Retz' opinion, elaborate
attention to trifle&#383; denote a little mind, the&#383;e are true
Lilliputian &#383;ages.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Augu&#383;t, 1794.</h2>
<p>I did not leave the Providence until &#383;ome days after the
date of my la&#383;t: there were &#383;o many precautions to be
taken, and &#383;o many formalities to be
ob&#383;erved&mdash;&#383;uch references from the municipality to
the di&#383;trict, and from the di&#383;trict to the Revolutionary
Committee, that it is evident Robe&#383;pierre's death has not
bani&#383;hed the u&#383;ual apprehen&#383;ion of danger from the
minds of tho&#383;e who became re&#383;pon&#383;ible for acts of
ju&#383;tice or humanity. At length, after procuring a
hou&#383;e-keeper to an&#383;wer with hi&#383; life and property
for our re-appearance, and for our attempting nothing again&#383;t
the "unity and indivi&#383;ibility" of the republic, we bade (I
hope) a long adieu to our pri&#383;on.</p>
<p>Madame de ____ is to remain with me till her hou&#383;e can be
repaired; for it has been in requi&#383;ition &#383;o often, that
there is now, we are told, &#383;carcely a bed left, or a room
habitable. We have an old man placed with us by way of a guard, but
he is civil, and is not intended to be a re&#383;traint upon us. In
fact, he has a &#383;on, a member of the Jacobin club, and this
opportunity is taken to compliment him, by taxing us with the
maintenance of his father. It does not prevent us from &#383;eeing
our acquaintance, and we might, I &#383;uppo&#383;e, go out, though
we have not yet ventured.</p>
<p>The politics of the Convention are fluctuating and
ver&#383;atile, as will ever be the ca&#383;e where men are
impelled by nece&#383;&#383;ity to act in oppo&#383;ition to their
principles. In their eagerne&#383;s to attribute all the pa&#383;t
exce&#383;&#383;es to Robe&#383;pierre, they have, unawares,
involved them&#383;elves in the obligation of not continuing the
&#383;ame &#383;y&#383;tem. They doubtle&#383;s expected, by the
fall of the tyrant, to become his &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ors; but
the people, weary of being dupes, and of hearing that tyrants were
fallen, without feeling any diminution of tyranny, have every where
manife&#383;ted a temper, which the Convention, in the pre&#383;ent
relaxed &#383;tate of its power, i&#383; fearful of making
experiments upon. Hence, great numbers of pri&#383;oner&#383; are
liberated, tho&#383;e that remain are treated more indulgently, and
the fury of revolutionary de&#383;poti&#383;m is in general
abated.</p>
<p>The Deputies who mo&#383;t readily a&#383;&#383;ent to
the&#383;e changes have a&#383;&#383;umed the appellation of
Moderates; (Heaven knows how much they are indebted to
compari&#383;on;) and the popularity they have acquired has both
offended and alarmed the more inflexible Jacobins. A motion has
ju&#383;t been made by one Louchet, that a li&#383;t of all
per&#383;ons lately enlarged &#383;hould be printed, with the names
of tho&#383;e Deputies who &#383;olicited in their favour, annexed;
and that &#383;uch ari&#383;tocrats as were thus di&#383;covered to
have regained their liberty, &#383;hould be
re-impri&#383;oned.&mdash;The decree pa&#383;&#383;ed, but was
&#383;o ill received by the people, that it was judged prudent to
repeal it the next day.</p>
<p>This circum&#383;tance &#383;eems to be the &#383;ignal of
di&#383;&#383;ention between the A&#383;&#383;embly and the Club:
the former, apprehen&#383;ive of revolting the public opinion on
the one hand, and de&#383;irous of conciliating the Jacobins on the
other, waver between indulgence and &#383;everity; but it is
ea&#383;y to di&#383;cover, that their variance with the Jacobins
is more a matter of expediency than principle, and that, were it
not for other con&#383;iderations, they would not &#383;uffer the
impri&#383;onment of a few thou&#383;and harmle&#383;s people to
interrupt the amity which has &#383;o long &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ted
between them&#383;elves and their ancient allies.&mdash;It is
written, "from their works you &#383;hall know them;" and
rea&#383;oning from this tenet, which is our be&#383;t authority,
(for who can boa&#383;t a &#383;cience in the human heart?) I am
ju&#383;tified in my opinion, and I know it to be that of many
per&#383;ons more competent to decide than my&#383;elf. If I could
have had doubts on the &#383;ubject, the occurrences of the
la&#383;t few days would have amply &#383;ati&#383;fied them.</p>
<p>However rejoiced the nation at large might be at the overthrow
of Robe&#383;pierre, no one was deceived as to the motives which
actuated hi&#383; colleagues in the Committee. Every day produced
new indications not only of their general concurrence in the
enormities of the government, but of their own per&#383;onal guilt.
The Convention, though it could not be in&#383;en&#383;ible of
this, was willing, with a complai&#383;ant prudence, to avoid the
&#383;candal of a public di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion, which mu&#383;t
irritate the Jacobins, and expo&#383;e its own weakne&#383;s by a
retro&#383;pect of the crimes it had applauded and &#383;upported.
Laurent Lecointre,* alone, and apparently unconnected with party,
has had the courage to exhibit an accu&#383;ation again&#383;t
Billaud, Collot, Barrere, and tho&#383;e of Robe&#383;pierre's
accomplices who were member&#383; of the Committee of General
Safety. He gave notice of his de&#383;ign on the eleventh of
Fructidor (28th of Augu&#383;t).</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Lecointre is a linen-draper at Ver&#383;ailles, an
original revolutioni&#383;t, and I believe of more decent character
than mo&#383;t included in that de&#383;cription. If we could be
per&#383;uaded that there were any real fanatics in the Convention,
I &#383;hould give Lecointre the credit of being among the number.
He &#383;eems, at lea&#383;t, to have &#383;ome material
circum&#383;tances in his favour&mdash;&#383;uch as
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing the means of living; of not having,
in appearance, enriched him&#383;elf by the revolution; and, of
being the only member who, after a &#383;core of decrees to that
purpo&#383;e, has ventured to produce an account of hi&#383;
fortune to the public.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;It was received everywhere but in the Convention with
applau&#383;e; and the public was flattered with the hope that
ju&#383;tice would attain another faction of its
oppre&#383;&#383;ors. On the &#383;ucceeding day, Lecointre
appeared at the tribune to read his charges. They conveyed, even to
the mo&#383;t prejudiced mind, an entire conviction, that the
members he accu&#383;ed were &#383;ole authors of a part, and
accomplices in all the crimes which had de&#383;olated their
country. Each charge was &#383;upported by material proof, which he
depo&#383;ited for the information of his colleagues. But this
wa&#383; unnece&#383;&#383;ary&mdash;his colleagues had no
de&#383;ire to be convinced; and, after overpowering him with
ridicule and in&#383;ult, they declared, without entering into any
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion, that they rejected the charges with
indignation, and that the members implicated had uniformly acted
according to their [own] wi&#383;hes, and tho&#383;e of the
nation.</p>
<p>As &#383;oon as this re&#383;ult was known in Paris, the people
became enraged and di&#383;gu&#383;ted, the public walks
re&#383;ounded with murmurs, the fermentation grew general, and
&#383;ome menaces were uttered of forcing the Convention to give
Lecointre a more re&#383;pectful hearing.&mdash;Intimidated by
&#383;uch unequivocal proofs of di&#383;approbation, when the
A&#383;&#383;embly met on the thirteenth, it wa&#383; decreed,
after much oppo&#383;ition from Tallien, that Lecointre &#383;hould
be allowed to reproduce his charges, and that they &#383;hould be
&#383;olemnly examined.</p>
<p>After all this, Lecointre, who&#383;e figure is almo&#383;t
ludicrous, and who i&#383; no orator, was to repeat a voluminous
denunciation, amid&#383;t the clamour, abu&#383;e, chicane, and
deri&#383;ion of the whole Convention. But there are occa&#383;ions
when the keene&#383;t ridicule is pointle&#383;s; when the mind,
armed by truth and elevated by humanity, rejects its in&#383;idious
effort&#383;&mdash;and, ab&#383;orbed by more laudable feelings,
de&#383;pi&#383;es even the &#383;mile of contempt. The
ju&#383;tice of Lecointre's cau&#383;e &#383;upplied his want of
external advantages: and his arguments were &#383;o clear and
&#383;o unan&#383;werable, that the plain diction in which they
were conveyed was more impre&#383;&#383;ive than the mo&#383;t
fini&#383;hed eloquence; and neither the malice nor
&#383;arca&#383;ms of hi&#383; enemies had any effect but on
tho&#383;e who were intere&#383;ted in &#383;ilencing or
confounding him. Yet, in proportion as the force of
Lecointre'&#383; denunciation became evident, the
A&#383;&#383;embly appeared anxious to &#383;uppre&#383;&#383; it;
and, after &#383;ome hour&#383;' &#383;candalous debate, during
which it wa&#383; frequently a&#383;&#383;erted that the&#383;e
charges could not be encouraged without criminating the entire
legi&#383;lative body, they decreed the whole to be fal&#383;e and
defamatory.</p>
<p>The accu&#383;ed members defended them&#383;elves with the
a&#383;&#383;urance of delinquent&#383; tried by their avowed
accomplices, and who are previou&#383;ly certain of favour and
acquittal; while Lecointre's conduct in the bu&#383;ine&#383;s
&#383;eems to have been that of a man determined to per&#383;evere
in an act of duty, which he has little rea&#383;on to hope will be
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It is &#383;aid, that, at the conclu&#383;ion of this
di&#383;graceful bu&#383;ine&#383;s, the members of the convention
crouded about the delinquents with their habitual &#383;ervility,
and appeared gratified that their &#383;ervice&#383; on the
occa&#383;ion had given them a claim to notice and
familiarity.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the galleries of the Convention were more than
u&#383;ually furni&#383;hed on the day with applauders, yet this
deci&#383;ion has been univer&#383;ally ill received. The time is
pa&#383;&#383;ed when the voice of rea&#383;on could be
&#383;ilenced by decrees. The &#383;tupendous tyranny of the
government, though not meliorated in principle, is relaxed in
practice; and this vote, far from operating in favour of the
culprits, has only &#383;erved to excite the public indignation,
and to render them more odious. Tho&#383;e who cannot judge of the
logical preci&#383;ion of Lecointre's arguments, or the
ju&#383;tne&#383;s of hi&#383; inferences, can feel that his
charges are merited. Every heart, every tongue, acknowledges the
guilt of tho&#383;e he has attacked. They are certain France has
been the prey of numberle&#383;s atrocitie&#383;&mdash;they are
certain, that the&#383;e were perpetrated by order of the
committee; that eleven members compo&#383;ed it; and that
Robe&#383;pierre and his a&#383;&#383;ociates being but three, did
not con&#383;titute a majority.</p>
<p>The&#383;e facts are now commented on with as much freedom as
can be expected among a people who&#383;e imaginations are yet
haunted by revolutionary tribunals and Ba&#383;tilles, and the
conclu&#383;ions are not favourable to the Convention. The national
di&#383;content is, however, &#383;u&#383;pended by the
ho&#383;tilities between the legi&#383;lature and the Jacobin club:
the latter &#383;till per&#383;i&#383;ts in demanding the
revolutionary &#383;y&#383;tem in its primitive &#383;everity,
while the former are re&#383;trained from compliance, not only by
the odium it mu&#383;t draw on them, but from a certainty that it
cannot be &#383;upported but through the agency of the popular
&#383;ocieties, who would thu&#383; again become their dictators. I
believe it is not unlikely that the people and the Convention are
both endeavouring to make in&#383;truments of each other to
de&#383;troy the common enemy; for the little popularity the
Convention enjoy is doubtle&#383;s owing to a &#383;uperior hatred
of the Jacobins: and the moderation which the former affect towards
the people, is equally influenced by a view of forming a powerful
balance again&#383;t the&#383;e obnoxious
&#383;ocieties.&mdash;While a &#383;ort of nece&#383;&#383;ity for
this temporizing continues, we &#383;hall go on very tranquilly,
and it is become a mode to &#383;ay the Convention is
"adorable."</p>
<p>Tallien, who has been wre&#383;tling with his ill fame for a
tran&#383;ient popularity, has thought it advi&#383;able to revive
the public attention by the farce of
Pi&#383;i&#383;tratu&#383;&mdash;at lea&#383;t, an attempt to
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inate him, in which there &#383;eems to
have been more eclat than danger, has given ri&#383;e to &#383;uch
an opinion. Bulletins of his health are delivered every day in form
to the Convention, and &#383;ome of the provincial clubs have
&#383;ent congratulations on his e&#383;cape. But the &#383;neers
of the incredulous, and perhaps an internal admonition of the
ridicule and di&#383;grace attendant on the wor&#383;hip of an idol
who&#383;e reputation is &#383;o unpropitious, have much
repre&#383;&#383;ed the cu&#383;tomary ardour, and will, I think,
prevent the&#383;e "hair-breadth '&#383;cape&#383;" from continuing
fa&#383;hionable.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>[No Date Given]</h2>
<p>When I de&#383;cribe the French as a people bending meekly
beneath the mo&#383;t ab&#383;urd and cruel oppre&#383;&#383;ion,
tran&#383;mitted from one &#383;et of tyrants to another, without
per&#383;onal &#383;ecurity, without commerce&mdash;menaced by
famine, and de&#383;olated by a government who&#383;e ordinary
re&#383;ources are pillage and murder; you may perhaps read with
&#383;ome &#383;urprize the progre&#383;s and
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es of their armies. But, dive&#383;t
your&#383;elf of the notions you may have imbibed from
intere&#383;ted mi&#383;repre&#383;entation&#383;&mdash;forget the
revolutionary common-place of "enthu&#383;iam&#383;",
"&#383;oldiers of freedom," and "defenders of their
country"&mdash;examine the French armies as acting under the
motive&#383; which u&#383;ually influence &#383;uch bodies, and I
am inclined to believe you will &#383;ee nothing very wonderful or
&#383;upernatural in their victories.</p>
<p>The greater part of the French troops are now compo&#383;ed of
young men taken indi&#383;criminately from all cla&#383;&#383;es,
and forced into the &#383;ervice by the fir&#383;t
requi&#383;ition. They arrive at the army ill-di&#383;po&#383;ed,
or at be&#383;t indifferent, for it mu&#383;t not be forgotten,
that all who could be prevailed on to go voluntarily had departed
before recour&#383;e was had to the mea&#383;ure of a general levy.
They are then di&#383;tributed into different corps, &#383;o that
no local connections remain: the natives of the North are mingled
with tho&#383;e of the South, and all provincial combinations are
interdicted.</p>
<p>It is well known that the military branch of e&#383;pionage is
as extended a&#383; the civil, and the certainty of this
de&#383;troys confidence, and leaves even the unwilling
&#383;oldier no re&#383;ource but to go through his
profe&#383;&#383;ional duty with as much zeal as though it were his
choice. On the one hand, the di&#383;cipline is
&#383;evere&mdash;on the other, licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s is
permitted beyond all example; and, half-terrified,
half-&#383;educed, principles the mo&#383;t inimical, and morals
the lea&#383;t corrupt, become habituated to fear nothing but the
government, and to reli&#383;h a life of military
indulgence.&mdash;The armies were &#383;ome time &#383;ince ill
clothed, and often ill fed; but the requi&#383;itions, which are
the &#383;courge of the country, &#383;upply them, for the moment,
with profu&#383;ion: the manufacturers, the &#383;hops, and the
private individual, are robbed to keep them in good
humour&mdash;the be&#383;t wines, the be&#383;t clothes, the prime
of every thing, is de&#383;tined to their u&#383;e; and men, who
before laboured hard to procure a &#383;canty
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, now revel in luxury and comparative
idlene&#383;s.</p>
<p>The rapid promotion acquired in the French army is likewi&#383;e
another cau&#383;e of its adherence to the government. Every one is
eager to be advanced; for, by means of requi&#383;itions, pillage
and perqui&#383;ites, the mo&#383;t trifling command is very
lucrative.&mdash;Va&#383;t &#383;ums of money are expended in
&#383;upplying the camps with new&#383;papers written nearly for
that purpo&#383;e, and no other&#383; are permitted to be publicly
circulated.&mdash;When troops are quartered in a town, in&#383;tead
of that cold reception which it is u&#383;ual to accord &#383;uch
inmates, the &#383;y&#383;tem of terror acts as an excellent
Marechal de Logis, and procures them, if not a cordial, at
lea&#383;t a &#383;ub&#383;tantial one; and it i&#383; indubitable,
that they are no where &#383;o well entertained as at the
hou&#383;e&#383; of profe&#383;&#383;ed ari&#383;tocrats. The
officers and men live in a familiarity highly gratifying to the
latter; and, indeed, neither are di&#383;tingui&#383;hable by their
language, manners, or appearance. There is, properly &#383;peaking,
no &#383;ubordination except in the field, and a &#383;oldier has
only to avoid politics, and cry "Vive la Convention!" to
&#383;ecure plenary indulgence on all other
occa&#383;ions.&mdash;Many who entered the army with regret,
continue there willingly for the &#383;ake of a maintenance;
be&#383;ides that a decree exi&#383;ts, which &#383;ubjects the
parents of tho&#383;e who return, to heavy puni&#383;hments. In a
word, whatever can operate on the fears, or intere&#383;ts, or
pa&#383;&#383;ions, is employed to pre&#383;erve the allegiance of
the armies to the government, and attach them to their
profe&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>I am far from intending to detract from the national
bravery&mdash;the annal&#383; of the French Monarchy abound with
the mo&#383;t &#383;plendid in&#383;tances of it&mdash;I only
wi&#383;h you to under&#383;tand, what I am fully convinced of
my&#383;elf, that liberty and republicani&#383;m have no &#383;hare
in the pre&#383;ent &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es. The battle of Gemappe
was gained when the Bri&#383;&#383;otin faction had enthroned
it&#383;elf on the ruins of a con&#383;titution, which the armies
were &#383;aid to adore with enthu&#383;ia&#383;m: by what
&#383;udden in&#383;piration were their affection&#383;
tran&#383;ferred to another form of government? or will any one
pretend that they really under&#383;tood the democratic
Machiaveli&#383;m which they were to propagate in Brabant? At the
battle of Maubeuge, France was in the fir&#383;t paroxy&#383;m of
revolutionary terror&mdash;at that of Fleurus, &#383;he had become
a &#383;cene of carnage and pro&#383;cription, at once the
mo&#383;t wretched and the mo&#383;t dete&#383;table of nations,
the &#383;port and the prey of de&#383;pots &#383;o contemptible,
that neither the exce&#383;s of their crimes, nor the
&#383;ufferings they inflicted, could efface the ridicule which was
incurred by a &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to them. Were the French
then fighting for liberty, or did they only move on
profe&#383;&#383;ionally, with the enemy in front, the Guillotine
in the rear, and the intermediate &#383;pace filled up with the
licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s of a camp?&mdash;If the name alone of
liberty &#383;uffices to animate the French troop&#383; to
conque&#383;t, and they could imagine it was enjoyed under
Bri&#383;&#383;ot or Robe&#383;pierre, this is at lea&#383;t a
proof that they are rather amateurs than connoi&#383;&#383;eurs;
and I &#383;ee no rea&#383;on why the &#383;ame impul&#383;e might
not be given to an army of Janizaries, or the the legions of Tippoo
Saib.</p>
<p>After all, it may be permitted to doubt, whether the &#383;ort
of enthu&#383;ia&#383;m &#383;o liberally a&#383;cribed to the
French, would really contribute more to their
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es, than the thoughtle&#383;s courage I am
willing to allow them.&mdash;It is, I believe, the opinion of
military men, that the be&#383;t &#383;oldiers are tho&#383;e who
are mo&#383;t di&#383;po&#383;ed to act mechanically; and we are
certain that the mo&#383;t brilliant victories have been obtained
where thi&#383; ardour, &#383;aid to be produced by the new
doctrines, could have had no influence.&mdash;The heroes of Pavia,
of Narva, or tho&#383;e who admini&#383;tered to the vain-glory of
Louis the Fourteenth, by ravaging the Palatinate, we may
&#383;uppo&#383;e little acquainted with it. The fate of battles
frequently depends on cau&#383;es which the General, the
State&#383;man, or the Philo&#383;opher, are equally unable to
decide upon; and the laurel, "meed of mighty conquerors,"
&#383;eems oftener to fall at the caprice of the wind, than to be
gathered. It is &#383;ometimes the lot of the able&#383;t
tactician, at others of the mo&#383;t voluminous mu&#383;ter-roll;
but, I believe, there are few example&#383; where the&#383;e
political elevations have had an effect, when unaccompanied by
advantages of &#383;ituation, &#383;uperior &#383;kill, or
&#383;uperior numbers.&mdash;<i>"La plupart des gens de guerre</i>
(&#383;ays Fontenelle) <i>&#383;ont leur metier avec beaucoup de
courage. Il en e&#383;t peu qui y pen&#383;ent; leurs bras
agi&#383;&#383;ent au&#383;&#383;i vigoureu&#383;ement que l'on
veut, leurs tetes &#383;e repo&#383;ent, et ne prennent
pre&#383;que part a rieu"</i>*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* "Military men in general do their duty with much
courage, but few make it a &#383;ubject of reflection. With all the
bodily activity that can be expected of them, their minds remain at
re&#383;t, and partake but little of the bu&#383;ine&#383;s they
are engaged in."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;If this can be applied with truth to any armies, it
mu&#383;t be to tho&#383;e of France. We have &#383;een them
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively and implicitly adopting all the new
con&#383;titutions and &#383;trange gods which faction and
extravagance could devi&#383;e&mdash;we have &#383;een them
alternately the dupes and &#383;laves of all parties: at one period
abandoning their King and their religion: at another adulating
Robe&#383;pierre, and deifying Marat.&mdash;The&#383;e, I
confe&#383;s are di&#383;po&#383;itions to make good &#383;oldiers,
but convey to me no idea of enthu&#383;ia&#383;ts or
republicans.</p>
<p>The bulletin of the Convention is periodically furni&#383;hed
with &#383;plendid feats of heroi&#383;m performed by individuals
of their armies, and I have no doubt but &#383;ome of them are
true. There are, however, many which have been very peaceably
culled from old memoirs, and that &#383;o un&#383;kilfully, that
the hero of the pre&#383;ent year lo&#383;es a leg or an arm in the
&#383;ame exploit, and uttering the &#383;elf-&#383;ame
&#383;entences, as one who lived two centuries ago. There is
likewi&#383;e a &#383;ort of jobbing in the edifying &#383;cenes
which occa&#383;ionally occur in the Convention&mdash;if a
&#383;oldier happen to be wounded who has relation&#383;hip,
acquaintance, or connexion, with a Deputy, a tale of extraordinary
valour and extraordinary devotion to the cau&#383;e is invented or
adopted; the invalid is pre&#383;ented in form at the bar of the
A&#383;&#383;embly, receives the fraternal embrace and the
promi&#383;e of a pen&#383;ion, and the feats of the hero, along
with the munificence of the Convention, are ordered to circulate in
the next bulletin. Yet many of the deeds recorded very
de&#383;ervedly in the&#383;e annals of glory, have been performed
by men who abhor republican principles, and lament the
di&#383;a&#383;ters their partizans have occa&#383;ioned. I have
known even notoriou&#383; ari&#383;tocrats introduced to the
Convention as martyrs to liberty, and who have, in fact, behaved as
gallantly as though they had been &#383;o.&mdash;The&#383;e are
paradoxes which a military man may ea&#383;ily reconcile.</p>
<p>Independently of the various &#383;econdary cau&#383;es that
contribute to the &#383;ucce&#383;s of the French armies, there is
one which tho&#383;e per&#383;ons who wi&#383;h to exalt every
thing they denominate republican &#383;eem to exclude&mdash;I mean,
the immen&#383;e advantage they po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s in point of
numbers. There ha&#383; &#383;carcely been an engagement of
importance, in which the French have not profited by this in a very
extraordinary degree.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This has been confe&#383;&#383;ed to me by many
republicans them&#383;elves; and a di&#383;proportion of two or
three to one mu&#383;t add con&#383;iderably to republican
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Whenever a point is to be gained, the &#383;acrifice of
men is not a matter of he&#383;itation. One body is di&#383;patched
after another; and fre&#383;h troop&#383; thus &#383;ucceeding to
oppo&#383;e tho&#383;e of the enemy already hara&#383;&#383;ed, we
mu&#383;t not wonder that the event has &#383;o often proved
favourable to them.</p>
<p>A republican, who pa&#383;&#383;es for highly informed, once
defended this mode of warfare by ob&#383;erving, that in the
cour&#383;e of &#383;everal campaigns more troop&#383;
peri&#383;hed by &#383;ickne&#383;s than the &#383;word. If then an
object could be attained by &#383;uch means, &#383;o much time was
&#383;aved, and the lo&#383;s eventually the &#383;ame: but the
Generals of other countries dare not ri&#383;k &#383;uch
philo&#383;ophical calculations, and would be accountable to the
laws of humanity for their de&#383;tructive conque&#383;ts.</p>
<p>When you e&#383;timate the numbers that compo&#383;e the French
armies, you are not to con&#383;ider them as an undi&#383;ciplined
multitude, who&#383;e &#383;ole force is in their numbers. From the
beginning of the revolution, many of them have been exerci&#383;ed
in the National Guard; and though they might not make a figure on
the parade at Pot&#383;dam, their inferiority is not &#383;o great
as to render the German exactitude a counterbalance for the
&#383;ub&#383;tantial inequality of numbers. Yet, powerfully as
the&#383;e con&#383;iderations favour the military triumphs of
France, there is a period when we may expect both cau&#383;e and
effect will terminate. That period may &#383;till be far removed,
but whenever the a&#383;&#383;ignat&#383;* become totally
di&#383;credited, and it &#383;hall be found requi&#383;ite to
economize in the war department, adieu la gloire, a bas les armes,
and perhaps bon &#383;oir la republique; for I do not reckon it
po&#383;&#383;ible, that armies &#383;o con&#383;tituted can ever
be per&#383;uaded to &#383;ubject them&#383;elves to the
re&#383;traints and privations which mu&#383;t be
indi&#383;pen&#383;ible, as &#383;oon as the government cea&#383;es
to have the di&#383;po&#383;al of an unlimited fund.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The mandats were, in fact, but a continuation of the
a&#383;&#383;ignats, under another name. The la&#383;t decree for
the emi&#383;&#383;ion of a&#383;&#383;ignats, limited the quantity
circulated to forty milliards, which taken at par, is only about
&#383;ixteen hundred millions of pounds &#383;terling!</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>What I have hitherto written you will under&#383;tand as
applicable only to the troops employed on the frontiers. There are
&#383;ome of another de&#383;cription, more cheri&#383;hed and not
le&#383;s &#383;erviceable, who act as a &#383;ort of police
militant and errant, and defend the republic again&#383;t her
internal enemie&#383;&mdash;the republicans. Almo&#383;t every town
of importance i&#383; occa&#383;ionally infe&#383;ted by the&#383;e
&#383;ervile in&#383;truments of de&#383;poti&#383;m, who are
maintained in in&#383;olent profu&#383;ion, to overawe tho&#383;e
whom mi&#383;ery and famine might tempt to revolt. When a
government, after impri&#383;oning &#383;ome hundred thou&#383;ands
of the mo&#383;t di&#383;tingui&#383;hed in every cla&#383;s of
life, and di&#383;arming all the re&#383;t, is yet obliged to
employ &#383;uch a force for its protection, we may
ju&#383;tifiably conclude, it does not pre&#383;ume on the
attachment of the people. It is not impo&#383;&#383;ible that the
agents of different de&#383;criptions, de&#383;tined to the
&#383;ervice of conciliating the interior to republicani&#383;m,
might alone form an army equal to that of the Allies; but this is a
ta&#383;k, where the numbers employed only &#383;erve to render it
more difficult. They, however, procure &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion,
if they do not create affection; and the Convention is not
delicate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Amiens, Sept. 30, 1794.</h2>
<p>The dome&#383;tic politics of France are replete with novelties:
the Convention is at war with the Jacobin&#383;&mdash;and the
people, even to the mo&#383;t decided ari&#383;tocrats, have become
partizans of the Convention.&mdash;My la&#383;t letters have
explained the origin of the&#383;e phaenomena, and I will now add a
few words on their progre&#383;s.</p>
<p>You have &#383;een that, at the fall of Robe&#383;pierre, the
revolutionary government had reached the very &#383;ummit of
de&#383;poti&#383;m, and that the Convention found them&#383;elves
under the nece&#383;&#383;ity of appearing to be directed by a new
impul&#383;e, or of acknowledging their participation in the crimes
they affected to deplore.&mdash;In con&#383;equence, almo&#383;t
without the direct repeal of any law, (except &#383;ome which
affected their own &#383;ecurity,) a more moderate &#383;y&#383;tem
has been gradually adopted, or, to &#383;peak more correctly, the
revolutionary one is &#383;uffered to relax. The Jacobins behold
the&#383;e popular mea&#383;ures with extreme jealou&#383;y, as a
mean&#383; which may in time render the legi&#383;lature
independent of them; and it i&#383; certainly not the lea&#383;t of
their di&#383;contents, that, after all their labours in the common
cau&#383;e, they find them&#383;elves excluded both from power and
emoluments. Accu&#383;tomed to carry every thing by violence, and
more ferocious than politic, they have, by in&#383;i&#383;ting on
the reincarceration of &#383;u&#383;pected people, attached a
numerous party to the Convention, which is thus warned that its own
&#383;afety depends on repre&#383;&#383;ing the influence of clubs,
which not only loudly demand that the pri&#383;ons may be again
filled, but frequently debate on the project of tran&#383;porting
all the "enemies of the republic" together.</p>
<p>The liberty of the pre&#383;s, al&#383;o, is a theme of
di&#383;cord not le&#383;s important than the emancipation of
ari&#383;tocrats. The Jacobins are decidedly adver&#383;e to it;
and it is a &#383;ort of revolutionary &#383;oleci&#383;m, that
tho&#383;e who boa&#383;t of having been the original
de&#383;troyers of de&#383;poti&#383;m, are now the advocates of
arbitrary impri&#383;onment, and re&#383;traints on the freedom of
the pre&#383;s. The Convention it&#383;elf is divided on the latter
&#383;ubject; and, after a revolution of five years, founded on the
doctrine of the right&#383; of man, it has become matter of
di&#383;pute&mdash;whether &#383;o principal an article of them
ought really to exi&#383;t or not. They &#383;eem, indeed, willing
to allow it, provided re&#383;trictions can be devi&#383;ed which
may prevent calumny from reaching their own per&#383;ons; but as
that cannot ea&#383;ily be atchieved, they not only contend
again&#383;t the liberty of the pre&#383;s in practice, but have
hitherto refu&#383;ed to &#383;anction it by decree, even as a
principle.</p>
<p>It is perhaps reluctantly that the Convention oppo&#383;es
the&#383;e powerful and extended combinations which have &#383;o
long been its &#383;upport, and it may dread the con&#383;equences
of being left without the means of overawing or influencing the
people; but the example of the Bri&#383;&#383;otins, who, by
attempting to profit by the &#383;ervices of the Jacobins, without
&#383;ubmitting to their domination, fell a &#383;acrifice, has
warned their &#383;urvivors of the danger of employing &#383;uch
in&#383;truments. It is evident that the clubs will not act
&#383;ubordinately, and that they mu&#383;t either be &#383;ubdued
to in&#383;ignificance, or regain their authority entirely; and as
neither the people nor Convention are di&#383;po&#383;ed to
acquie&#383;ce in the latter, they are politicly joining their
efforts to accelerate the former.</p>
<p>Yet, notwith&#383;tanding the&#383;e reciprocal cajoleries, the
return of ju&#383;tice is &#383;low and mutable; an
in&#383;tinctive or habitual preference of evil appears at times to
direct the Convention, even in oppo&#383;ition to their own
intere&#383;ts. They have as yet done little towards repairing the
calamities of which they are the authors; and we welcome the little
they have done, not for its intrin&#383;ic value, but as we do the
fir&#383;t &#383;pring flower&#383;&mdash;which, though of no great
&#383;weetne&#383;s or beauty, we con&#383;ider a&#383; pledges
that the &#383;torms of winter are over, and that a milder
&#383;ea&#383;on i&#383; approaching.&mdash;It is true, the
revolutionary Committees are dimini&#383;hed in number, the
pri&#383;ons are di&#383;encumbered, and a man is not liable to be
arre&#383;ted becau&#383;e a Jacobin &#383;u&#383;pects his
features: yet there is a wide difference between &#383;uch
toleration and freedom and &#383;ecurity; and it is a
circum&#383;tance not favourable to tho&#383;e who look beyond the
moment, that the tyrannical laws which authorized all the late
enormities are &#383;till unrepealed. The Revolutionary Tribunal
continues to &#383;entence people to death, on pretexts as
frivolous as tho&#383;e which were employed in the time of
Robe&#383;pierre; they have only the advantage of being tried more
formally, and of forfeiting their lives upon proof, in&#383;tead of
without it, for actions that a &#383;trictly admini&#383;tered
ju&#383;tice would not puni&#383;h by a month's
impri&#383;onment.*</p>

<p>A ceremony has lately taken place, the object of which was to
depo&#383;it the a&#383;hes of Marat in the Pantheon, and to
di&#383;lodge the bu&#383;t of Mirabeau&mdash; who,
notwith&#383;tanding two years notice to quit this man&#383;ion of
immortality, &#383;till remained there. The a&#383;hes of Marat
being e&#383;corted to the Convention by a detachment of Jacobins,
and the Pre&#383;ident having properly de&#383;canted on the
virtues which once animated the &#383;aid a&#383;hes, they were
conveyed to the place de&#383;tined for their reception; and the
excommunicated Mirabeau being delivered over to the &#383;ecular
arm of a beadle, the&#383;e remains of the divine Marat were placed
among the re&#383;t of the republican deities. To have obliged the
Convention in a body to attend and con&#383;ecrate the crimes of
this mon&#383;ter, though it could not degrade them, was a
momentary triumph for the Jacobins, nor could the royali&#383;ts
behold without &#383;ati&#383;faction the &#383;ame men deploring
the death of Marat, who, a month before, had celebrated the fall of
Louis the Sixteenth! To have been &#383;o deplored, and &#383;o
celebrated, are, methinks, the very extremes of infamy and
glory.</p>
<p>I mu&#383;t explain to you, that the Jacobins have lately been
compo&#383;ed of two partie&#383;&mdash;the avowed adherents of
Collot, Billaud, &amp;c. and the concealed remains of tho&#383;e
attached to Robe&#383;pierre; but party has now given way to
principle, a circum&#383;tance not u&#383;ual; and the whole club
of Paris, with &#383;everal of the affiliated ones, join in
cen&#383;uring the innovating tendencies of the
Convention.&mdash;It is curious to read the debates of the parent
&#383;ociety, which pa&#383;s in afflicting details of the
per&#383;ecution&#383; experienced by the patriots on the parts of
the moderates and ari&#383;tocrats, who, they a&#383;&#383;ert, are
become &#383;o daring as even to call in que&#383;tion the purity
of the immortal Marat. You will &#383;uppo&#383;e, of cour&#383;e,
that this cruel per&#383;ecution is nothing more than an
interdiction to per&#383;ecute others; and their notions of
patrioti&#383;m and moderation may be conceived by their having
ju&#383;t expelled Tallien and Freron as moderates.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Freron endeavoured, on this occa&#383;ion, to
di&#383;culpate him&#383;elf from the charge of
"moderanti&#383;me," by alledging he had oppo&#383;ed Lecointre's
denunciation of Barrere, &amp;c.&mdash;and certainly one who piques
him&#383;elf on being the pupil of the divine Marat, was worthy of
remaining in the fraternity from which he was now
expelled.&mdash;Freron is a veteran journali&#383;t of the
revolution, of better talents, though not of better fame, than the
generality of his contemporaries: or, rather, his early efforts in
exciting the people to rebellion entitle him to a preeminence of
infamy.</blockquote>

<h2>Amiens, October 4, 1794.</h2>
<p>We have had our guard withdrawn for &#383;ome days; and I am
ju&#383;t now returned from Peronne, where we had been in order to
&#383;ee the &#383;eals taken off the papers, &amp;c. which I left
there la&#383;t year. I am much &#383;truck with the alteration
ob&#383;ervable in people's countenances. Every per&#383;on I meet
&#383;eems to have contracted a &#383;ort of revolutionary
a&#383;pect: many walk with their heads down, and with
half-&#383;hut eyes mea&#383;ure the whole length of a &#383;treet,
as though they were &#383;till intent on avoiding greetings from
the &#383;u&#383;picious; &#383;ome look grave and
&#383;orrow-worn; &#383;ome apprehen&#383;ive, as if in hourly
expectation of a <i>mandat d'arret;</i> and others ab&#383;olutely
ferocious, from a habit of affecting the barbarity of the
times.</p>
<p>Their language is nearly as much changed as their
appearance&mdash;the revolutionary jargon is univer&#383;al, and
the mo&#383;t di&#383;tingui&#383;hed ari&#383;tocrat&#383;
conver&#383;e in the &#383;tyle of Barrere's reports. The common
people are not le&#383;s proficients in this fa&#383;hionable
dialect, than their &#383;uperiors; and, as far as I can judge, are
become &#383;o from &#383;imilar motives. While I wa&#383; waiting
this morning at a &#383;hop-door, I li&#383;tened to a beggar who
wa&#383; cheapening a &#383;lice of pumpkin, and on &#383;ome
di&#383;agreement about the price, the beggar told the old
<i>revendeu&#383;e</i> [Market-woman.] that &#383;he wa&#383;
<i>"gangrenee d'ari&#383;tocratie."</i> ["Eat up with
ari&#383;tocracy."] <i>"Je vous en defie,"</i> ["I defy you."]
retorted the pumpkin-merchant; but turning pale as &#383;he
&#383;poke, <i>"Mon civi&#383;me e&#383;t a toute epreuve, mais
prenez donc ta citrouille,"</i> ["My civi&#383;m is
unque&#383;tionable; but here take your pumpkin."] take it then."
<i>"Ah, te voila bonne republicaine,</i> ["Ah! Now I &#383;ee you
are a good republican."] &#383;ays the beggar, carrying off her
bargain; while the old woman muttered, <i>"Oui, oui, l'on a beau
etre republicaine tandi&#383; qu'on n'a pas de pain a manger."</i>
["Yes, in troth, it's a fine thing to be a republican, and have no
bread to eat."]</p>
<p>I hear little of the po&#383;itive merits of the convention, but
the hope i&#383; general that they will &#383;oon
&#383;uppre&#383;s the Jacobin clubs; yet their attack&#383;
continue &#383;o cold and cautious, that their intentions are at
lea&#383;t doubtful: they know the voice of the nation at large
would be in favour of &#383;uch a mea&#383;ure, and they might, if
&#383;incere, act more deci&#383;ively, without ri&#383;k to
them&#383;elves.&mdash;The truth is, they would willingly
pro&#383;cribe the per&#383;ons of the Jacobins, while they cling
to their principles, and &#383;till he&#383;itate whether they
&#383;hall confide in a people who&#383;e re&#383;entment they have
&#383;o much de&#383;erved, and have &#383;o much rea&#383;on to
dread. Con&#383;ciou&#383; guilt appears to &#383;hackle all their
proceedings, and though the puni&#383;hment of &#383;ome
&#383;ubordinate agents cannot, in the pre&#383;ent &#383;tate of
things, be di&#383;pen&#383;ed with, yet the A&#383;&#383;embly
unveil the regi&#383;ter of their crimes very reluctantly, as if
each member expected to &#383;ee his own name in&#383;cribed on it.
Thus, even delinquents, who would otherwi&#383;e be &#383;acrificed
voluntarily to public ju&#383;tice, are in a manner protected by
delays and chicane, becau&#383;e an inve&#383;tigation might
implicate the Convention as the example and authori&#383;er of
their enormities.&mdash;Fouquier Tinville devoted a thou&#383;and
innocent people to death in le&#383;s time than it has already
taken to bring him to a trial, where he will benefit by all
tho&#383;e judicial forms which he has &#383;o often refu&#383;ed
to others. This man, who is much the &#383;ubject of
conver&#383;ation at pre&#383;ent, was Public Accu&#383;er to the
Revolutionary Tribunal&mdash;an office which, at be&#383;t, in this
in&#383;tance, only &#383;erved to give an air of regularity to
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ination: but, by a &#383;ort of genius in
turpitude, he contrived to render it odious beyond its original
perver&#383;ion, in giving to the mo&#383;t elaborate and revolting
cruelties a turn of &#383;pontaneous plea&#383;antry, or legal
procedure.&mdash;The pri&#383;oners were in&#383;ulted with
&#383;arca&#383;ms, intimidated by threats, and &#383;till oftener
&#383;ilenced by arbitrary declarations, that they were not
entitled to &#383;peak; and tho&#383;e who were taken to the
&#383;caffold, after no other ceremony than calling over their
names, had le&#383;s rea&#383;on to complain, than if they had
previou&#383;ly been expo&#383;ed to the barbarities of &#383;uch
trials.&mdash;Yet thi&#383; wretch might, for a time at lea&#383;t,
have e&#383;caped puni&#383;hment, had he not, in defending
him&#383;elf, criminated the remains of the Committee, whom it was
intended to &#383;creen. When he appeared at the bar of the
Convention, every word he uttered &#383;eemed to fill its members
with alarm, and he wa&#383; ordered away before he could
fini&#383;h his declaration. It mu&#383;t be acknowledged, that,
however he may be condemned by ju&#383;tice and humanity, nothing
could legally attach to him: he was only the agent of the
Convention, and the utmo&#383;t horrors of the Tribunal were not
merely &#383;anctioned, but enjoined by &#383;pecific decrees.</p>
<p>I have been told by a gentleman who was at &#383;chool with
Fouquier, and ha&#383; had frequent occa&#383;ions of
ob&#383;erving him at different periods &#383;ince, that he always
appeared to him to be a man of mild manners, and by no mean&#383;
likely to become the in&#383;trument of the&#383;e atrocities; but
a &#383;trong addiction to gaming having involved him in
embarra&#383;&#383;ments, he was induced to accept the office of
Public Accu&#383;er to the Tribunal, and wa&#383;
progre&#383;&#383;ively led on from admini&#383;tering to the
iniquity of his employers, to find a gratification in it
him&#383;elf.</p>
<p>I have often thought, that the habit of watching with
&#383;elfi&#383;h avidity for tho&#383;e turns of fortune which
enrich one individual by the mi&#383;ery of another, mu&#383;t
imperceptibly tend to harden the heart. How can the game&#383;ter,
accu&#383;tomed both to &#383;uffer and inflict ruin with
indifference, pre&#383;erve that benevolent frame of mind, which,
in the ordinary and le&#383;&#383; cen&#383;urable pur&#383;uits of
common life, is but too prone to become impaired, and to leave
humanity more a duty than a feeling?</p>
<p>The conduct of Fouquier Tinville has led me to &#383;ome
reflections on a &#383;ubject which I know the French con&#383;ider
as matter of triumph, and as a peculiar advantage which their
national character enjoys over the Engli&#383;h&mdash;I mean that
&#383;moothne&#383;s of manner and guardedne&#383;s of
expre&#383;&#383;ion which they call "aimable," and which they have
the faculty of attaining and pre&#383;erving di&#383;tinctly from a
corre&#383;pondent temper of the mind. It accompanies them through
the mo&#383;t irritating vici&#383;&#383;itudes, and enable&#383;
them to deceive, even without deceit: for though this &#383;uavity
i&#383; habitual, of cour&#383;e frequently unde&#383;igning, the
&#383;tranger is neverthele&#383;&#383; thrown off his guard by it,
and tempted to place confidence, or expect &#383;ervices, which a
le&#383;s conciliating deportment would not have been
&#383;ugge&#383;ted. A Frenchman may be an unkind hu&#383;band, a
&#383;evere parent, or an arrogant ma&#383;ter, yet never contract
his features, or a&#383;perate his voice, and for this rea&#383;on
is, in the national &#383;en&#383;e, "un homme bien doux." Hi&#383;
heart may become corrupt, his principles immoral, and his
di&#383;po&#383;ition ferociou&#383;&mdash;yet he &#383;hall
&#383;till retain his equability of tone and complacent
phra&#383;eology, and be "un homme bien aimable."</p>
<p>The revolution has tended much to develope this peculiarity of
the French character, and has, by various examples in public life,
confirmed the opinions I had formed from previous ob&#383;ervation.
Fouquier Tinville, as I have already noticed, was a man of gentle
exterior.&mdash;Couthon, the execrable a&#383;&#383;ociate of
Robe&#383;pierre, was mildne&#383;s
it&#383;elf&mdash;Robe&#383;pierre'&#383; harangues are in a
&#383;tyle of di&#383;tingui&#383;hed
&#383;en&#383;ibility&mdash;and even Carrier, the de&#383;troyer of
thirty thou&#383;and Nantais, is atte&#383;ted by hi&#383;
fellow-&#383;tudents to have been of an amiable
di&#383;po&#383;ition. I know a man of mo&#383;t in&#383;inuating
addre&#383;s, who has been the means of conducting his own brother
to the Guillotine; and another nearly as
prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing, who, without lo&#383;ing his
courteous demeanor, was, during the late revolutionary
exce&#383;&#383;es, the intimate of an executioner.</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>*It would be too voluminous to enumerate all the
contra&#383;ts of manners and character exhibited during the French
revolution&mdash;The philo&#383;ophic Condorcet, pur&#383;uing with
malignancy his patron, the Duc de la Rochefoucault, and
he&#383;itating with atrocious mildne&#383;s on the &#383;entence
of the King&mdash;The ma&#383;&#383;acres of the pri&#383;ons
connived at by the gentle Petion&mdash;Collot d'Herbois
di&#383;patching, by one di&#383;charge of cannon, three hundred
people together, "to &#383;pare his &#383;en&#383;ibility" the talk
of executions in detail&mdash;And St. Ju&#383;t, the devi&#383;er
of a thou&#383;and enormities, when he left the Committee, after
his la&#383;t interview, with the project of &#383;ending them all
to the Guillotine, telling them, in a tone of tender reproach, like
a lover of romance, "Vous avez fletri mon coeur, je vais l'ouvrir a
la Convention."&mdash; Madame Roland, in &#383;pite of the
tenderne&#383;s of her &#383;ex, could coldly rea&#383;on on the
expediency of a civil war, which &#383;he acknowledged might become
nece&#383;&#383;ary to e&#383;tabli&#383;h the republic. Let
tho&#383;e who di&#383;approve this cen&#383;ure of a female, whom
it is a &#383;ort of mode to lament, recollect that Madame Roland
was the victim of a celebrity &#383;he had acquired in
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ting the efforts of faction to dethrone the
King&mdash;that her literary bureau was dedicated to the
purpo&#383;e of exa&#383;perating the people again&#383;t
him&mdash;and that &#383;he was con&#383;iderably in&#383;trumental
to the events which occa&#383;ioned his death. If her talents and
accompli&#383;hments make her an object of regret, it was to the
unnatural mi&#383;application of tho&#383;e talents and
accompli&#383;hments in the &#383;ervice of party, that &#383;he
owed her fate. Her own opinion was, that thou&#383;ands might
ju&#383;tifiably be devoted to the e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of a
favourite &#383;y&#383;tem; or, to &#383;peak truly, to the
aggrandi&#383;ement of tho&#383;e who were its partizans. The
&#383;ame &#383;elfi&#383;h principle actuated an oppo&#383;ite
faction, and &#383;he became the &#383;acrifice.&mdash;"Oh
even-handed ju&#383;tice!"</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not pretend to decide whether the Engli&#383;h are
virtually more gentle in their nature than the French; but I am
per&#383;uaded this douceur, on which the latter pride
them&#383;elves, affords no proof of the contrary. An
Engli&#383;hman is &#383;eldom out of humour, without proclaiming
it to all the world; and the mo&#383;t forcible motives of
intere&#383;t, or expediency, cannot always prevail on him to
a&#383;&#383;ume a more engaging external than that which
delineates his feelings.</p>
<p>If he has a matter to refu&#383;e, he u&#383;ually begins by
fortifying him&#383;elf with a little ruggedne&#383;s of manner, by
way of prefacing a denial he might otherwi&#383;e not have
re&#383;olution to per&#383;evere in. "The hows and whens of life"
corrugate his features, and di&#383;harmonize his periods;
contradiction &#383;ours, and pa&#383;&#383;ion ruffles
him&mdash;and, in &#383;hort, an Engli&#383;hman
di&#383;plea&#383;ed, from whatever cau&#383;e, is neither "un
homme bien doux," nor "un homme bien aimable;" but &#383;uch as
nature has made him, &#383;ubject to infirmities and &#383;orrows,
and unable to di&#383;gui&#383;e the one, or appear indifferent to
the other. Our country, like every other, has doubtle&#383;s
produced too many examples of human depravity; but I &#383;carcely
recollect any, where a ferocious di&#383;po&#383;ition was not
accompanied by corre&#383;ponding manner&#383;&mdash;or where men,
who would plunder or ma&#383;&#383;acre, affected to retain at the
&#383;ame time habits of &#383;oftne&#383;s, and a conciliating
phy&#383;iognomy.</p>
<p>We are, I think, on the whole, authorized to conclude, that, in
determining the claims to national &#383;uperiority, the
boa&#383;ted and unvarying controul which the French exerci&#383;e
over their features and accents, i&#383; not a merit; nor
tho&#383;e indications of what pa&#383;&#383;es within, to which
the Engli&#383;h are &#383;ubject, an imperfection. If the French
&#383;ometimes &#383;upply their want of kindne&#383;s, or render
di&#383;appointment le&#383;s acute at the moment, by a
&#383;terile complacency, the Engli&#383;h har&#383;hne&#383;s is
often only the alloy to an efficient benevolence, and a
&#383;ympathizing mind. In France they have no humouri&#383;ts who
&#383;eem impelled by their nature to do good, in &#383;pite of
their temperament&mdash;nor have we in England many people who are
cold and unfeeling, yet &#383;y&#383;tematically aimable: but I
mu&#383;t &#383;till per&#383;i&#383;t in not thinking it a defect
that we are too impetuous, or perhaps too ingenuous, to unite
contradictions.</p>
<p>There is a cau&#383;e, that doubtle&#383;s has its effects in
repre&#383;enting the Engli&#383;h di&#383;advantageou&#383;ly, and
which I have never heard properly allowed for. The liberty of the
pre&#383;s, and the great intere&#383;t taken by all rank&#383; of
people in public affairs, have occa&#383;ioned a more numerous
circulation of periodical prints of every kind in England, than in
any other country in Europe. Now, as it is impo&#383;&#383;ible to
fill them con&#383;tantly with politics, and as the ta&#383;te of
different readers mu&#383;t be con&#383;ulted, every barbarous
adventure, &#383;uicide, murder, robbery, dome&#383;tic fracas,
a&#383;&#383;aults, and batteries of the lower orders, with the
duels and divorces of the higher, are all chronicled in various
publications, di&#383;&#383;eminated over Europe, and convey an
idea that we are a very mi&#383;erable, ferocious, and
di&#383;&#383;olute nation. The foreign gazettes being chiefly
appropriated to public affairs, &#383;eldom record either the
vices, the crimes, or mi&#383;fortunes of individuals; &#383;o that
they are thereby at lea&#383;t prevented from fixing an
unfavourable judgement on the national character.</p>
<p>Mercier ob&#383;erves, that the number of &#383;uicides
committed in Paris wa&#383; &#383;uppo&#383;ed to exceed greatly
that of &#383;imilar di&#383;a&#383;ters in London; and that
murders in France were always accompanied by circum&#383;tances of
peculiar horror, though policy and cu&#383;tom had rendered the
publication of &#383;uch events le&#383;s general than with
us.&mdash;Our divorces, at which the Gallic purity of manners
u&#383;ed to be &#383;o much &#383;candalized, are, no doubt, to be
regretted; but that &#383;uch &#383;eparations were not then
allowed, or de&#383;ired in France, may perhaps be attributed, at
lea&#383;t as ju&#383;tly, to the complai&#383;ance of
hu&#383;bands, as to the di&#383;cretion of wives, or the national
morality.*</p>

number of divorces in France, is often nearly equal to that of the

<p>I &#383;hould reproach my&#383;elf if I could feel impartial
when I contemplate the Engli&#383;h character; yet I certainly
endeavour to write as though I were &#383;o. If I have erred, it

<h2>October 6, 1794.</h2>
<p>The &#383;ufferings of individuals have often been the means of
de&#383;troying or reforming the mo&#383;t powerful tyrannies;
rea&#383;on has been convinced by argument, and pa&#383;&#383;ion
appealed to by declamation in vain&mdash;when &#383;ome
unvarni&#383;hed tale, or &#383;imple expo&#383;ure of facts, has
at once rouzed the feelings, and conquered the &#383;upinene&#383;s
of an oppre&#383;&#383;ed people.</p>
<p>The revolutionary government, in &#383;pite of the clamorous and
weekly &#383;wearings of the Convention to perpetuate it, has
received a check from an event of this nature, which I tru&#383;t
it will never recover.&mdash;By an order of the Revolutionary
Committee of Nantes, in November 1793, all pri&#383;oners
accu&#383;ed of political crimes were to be tran&#383;ferred to
Paris, where the tribunal being more immediately under the
direction of government, there would be no chance of their
acquittal. In con&#383;equence of this order, an hundred and
thirty-two inhabitants of Nantes, arre&#383;ted on the u&#383;ual
pretexts of foederali&#383;m, or as &#383;u&#383;pected, or being
Mu&#383;cadins, were, &#383;ome months after, conducted to Paris.
Forty of the number died through the hard&#383;hips and ill
treatment they encountered on the way, the re&#383;t remained in
pri&#383;on until after the death of Robe&#383;pierre.</p>
<p>The evidence produced on their trial, which lately took place,
ha&#383; revealed but too circum&#383;tantially all the horrors of
the revolutionary &#383;y&#383;tem. De&#383;truction in every form,
mo&#383;t &#383;hocking to morals or humanity, has depopulated the
countries of the Loire; and republican Pizarro's and Almagro's
&#383;eem to have rivalled each other in the invention and
perpetration of crimes.</p>
<p>When the pri&#383;ons of Nantes overflowed, many hundreds of
their mi&#383;erable inhabitants had been conducted by night, and
chained together, to the river &#383;ide; where, being fir&#383;t
&#383;tripped of their clothes, they were crouded into
ve&#383;&#383;els with fal&#383;e bottoms, con&#383;tructed for the
purpo&#383;e, and &#383;unk.*&mdash;</p>

January, and conducted, during the &#383;ilence of the night, to

de&#383;truction&mdash;they are chained down, to prevent their
e&#383;cape by &#383;wimming, and then the bottom is detached for
the upper part, and &#383;unk.&mdash;On &#383;ome occa&#383;ions
the mi&#383;erable victims contrived to loo&#383;e them&#383;elves,

wretches to whom mercy was a &#383;tranger; and, being cut away

peri&#383;hed with their companions. That nothing might be wanting

devi&#383;ed, a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted, or connived at, by Deputies
of the Convention, celebrated for their ardent republicani&#383;m
and revolutionary zeal.&mdash;The danger of confiding unlimited
power to &#383;uch men as compo&#383;ed the majority of the

penetrated the dulle&#383;t imagination, and the colde&#383;t

revolutionary committees, revolutionary troops, and revolutionary
vehicles of de&#383;truction,* mi&#383;&#383;ionaries &#383;elected
by choice from the whole repre&#383;entation, had, in the city of

<p>Facts like the&#383;e require no comment. The nation may be

a Herault de Sechelles,* or a Lequinio.**&mdash;</p>

Carrier, applauding his enormities, and advi&#383;ing him how to
continue them with effect.&mdash;Herault was of a noble family, and
had been a pre&#383;ident in the Parliament of Paris. He was one of
Robe&#383;pierre's Committee of Public Welfare, and being in

<p>&mdash;The ninety Nantais, again&#383;t whom there exi&#383;ted
no &#383;erious charge, and who had already &#383;uffered more than
death, were acquitted. Yet, though the people were gratified by
this verdict, and the general indignation appea&#383;ed by an
immediate arre&#383;t of tho&#383;e who had been mo&#383;t
notoriou&#383;ly active in the&#383;e dreadful operations, a deep
and &#383;alutary impre&#383;&#383;ion remains, and we may hope it
will be found impracticable either to renew the &#383;ame
&#383;cenes, or for the Convention to &#383;helter (as they
&#383;eemed di&#383;po&#383;ed to do) the principal criminals, who
are members of their own body. Yet, how are the&#383;e delinquents
to be brought to condemnation? They all acted under competent
authority, and their di&#383;patches to the Convention, which
&#383;ufficiently indicated their proceedings, were alway&#383;
&#383;anctioned by circulation, and applauded, according to the
exce&#383;s of their flagitiou&#383;ne&#383;s.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that Nantes, the principal theatre of
the&#383;e per&#383;ecutions and murders, had been early
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by the attachment of its inhabitants to the
revolution; in&#383;omuch, that, at the memorable epoch when the
&#383;hort-&#383;ighted policy of the Court excluded the
Con&#383;tituent A&#383;&#383;embly from their Hall at
Ver&#383;ailles, and they took refuge in the Jeu de Paume, with a
re&#383;olution fatal to their country, never to &#383;eparate
until they had obtained their purpo&#383;es, an expre&#383;s was
&#383;ent to Nantes, a&#383; the place they &#383;hould make choice
of, if any violence obliged them to quit the neighbourhood of
Paris.</p>
<p>But it was not only by its principles that Nantes had
&#383;ignalized it&#383;elf; at every period of the war, it had
contributed largely both in men and money, and its riches and
commerce &#383;till rendered it one of the mo&#383;t important
towns of the republic.&mdash;What has been its
reward?&mdash;Barbarou&#383; envoys from the Convention, &#383;ent
expre&#383;&#383;ly to level the ari&#383;tocracy of wealth, to
cru&#383;h its mercantile &#383;pirit, and decimate its
inhabitants.*&mdash;</p>

&#383;upply of provi&#383;ions. They applied to Carrier, as being
be&#383;t acquainted with their di&#383;tre&#383;s, and were
an&#383;wered in this language:&mdash;<i>"Demandez, pour

<p>I have hitherto &#383;aid little of La Vendee; but the fate of

<h2>[No Date or Place Given.]</h2>
<p>It appears, that the greater part of the inhabitants of Poitou,
Anjou, and the Southern divi&#383;ions of Brittany, now
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by the general appellation of the people of
La Vendee, (though they include tho&#383;e of &#383;everal other
departments,) never either comprehended or adopted the principles
of the French revolution. Many different cau&#383;es contributed to
increa&#383;e their original aver&#383;ion from the new
&#383;y&#383;tem, and to give their re&#383;i&#383;tance that
con&#383;i&#383;tency, which has &#383;ince become &#383;o
formidable. A partiality for their ancient cu&#383;toms, an
attachment to their Noble&#383;&#383;e, and a deference for their
Prie&#383;ts, are &#383;aid to characterize the brave and
&#383;imple natives of La Vendee. Hence republican writers, with
&#383;elf-complacent deci&#383;ion, always treat this war as the
effect of ignorance, &#383;lavery, and &#383;uper&#383;tition.</p>
<p>The modern reformi&#383;t, who calls the labourer from the
plough, and the artizan from the loom, to make them
&#383;tate&#383;men or philo&#383;ophers, and who has invaded the
abodes of contented indu&#383;try with the rights of man, that our
fields may be cultivated, and our garments wove, by
metaphy&#383;icians, will readily a&#383;&#383;ent to this
opinion.&mdash;Yet a more enlightened and liberal philo&#383;ophy
may be tempted to examine how far the Vendeans have really merited
the contempt and per&#383;ecution of which they have been the
objects. By the confe&#383;&#383;ion of the republicans
them&#383;elves, they are religious, ho&#383;pitable, and frugal,
humane and merciful towards their enemies, and ea&#383;ily
per&#383;uaded to whatever is ju&#383;t and rea&#383;onable.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to combat the narrow prejudices of tho&#383;e
who &#383;uppo&#383;e the worth or happine&#383;s of mankind
compatible but with one &#383;et of opinions; and who, confounding
the adventitious with the e&#383;&#383;ential, appreciate only book
learning: but &#383;urely, qualities which imply a knowledge of
what i&#383; due both to God and man, and information
&#383;ufficient to yield to what i&#383; right or rational, are not
de&#383;criptive of barbarians; or at lea&#383;t, we may &#383;ay
with Phyrrhus, "there is nothing barbarous in their
di&#383;cipline."*</p>

men of &#383;imple manners, naturally well inclined, or at
lea&#383;t not addicted to &#383;erious vices." Lequinio, Guerre de
La Vendee. Dubois de Crance, &#383;peaking of the inhabitants of La
Vendee, &#383;ays, "They are the mo&#383;t ho&#383;pitable people I

them over to their own party, and often &#383;ending them back to
us with only a &#383;imple prohibition to bear arm&#383;

of profiting by.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;Their adherence to their ancient in&#383;titutions, and
attachment to their Gentry and Clergy, when the former were
aboli&#383;hed and the latter pro&#383;cribed, might warrant a
pre&#383;umption that they were happy under the one, and kindly
treated by the other: for though individuals may &#383;ometimes
per&#383;evere in affections or habits from which they derive
neither felicity nor advantage, whole bodies of men can
&#383;carcely be &#383;uppo&#383;ed eager to ri&#383;k their lives
in defence of privileges that have oppre&#383;&#383;ed them, or of
a religion from which they draw no con&#383;olation.</p>
<p>But whatever the cau&#383;e, the new doctrines, both civil and
religious, were received in La Vendee with a di&#383;gu&#383;t,
which was not only expre&#383;&#383;ed by murmurs, but
occa&#383;ionally by little revolts, by di&#383;obedience to the
con&#383;titutional authorities, and a rejection of the
con&#383;titutional clergy.</p>
<p>Some time previous to the depo&#383;ition of the King,
Commi&#383;&#383;ioners were &#383;ent to &#383;uppre&#383;s
the&#383;e di&#383;orders; and though I doubt not but all
po&#383;&#383;ible means were taken to conciliate, I can
ea&#383;ily believe, that neither the King nor his Mini&#383;ters
might be de&#383;irous of &#383;ubduing by force a people who erred
only from piety or loyalty. What effect this &#383;y&#383;tem of
indulgence might have produced cannot now be decided; becau&#383;e
the &#383;ub&#383;equent overthrow of the monarchy, and the
ma&#383;&#383;acre or bani&#383;hment of the prie&#383;ts,
mu&#383;t have totally alienated their minds, and precluded all
hope of reconcilement.&mdash;Di&#383;affection, therefore,
continued to increa&#383;e, and the Bri&#383;&#383;otines are
&#383;u&#383;pected of having rather fo&#383;tered than
repre&#383;&#383;ed the&#383;e inte&#383;tine commotions,* for the
&#383;ame purpo&#383;e which induced them to provoke the war with
England, and to extend that of the Continent.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Le Brun, one of the Bri&#383;&#383;otin
Mini&#383;ters, concealed the progre&#383;s of this war for
&#383;ix months before he thought fit to report it to the
Convention.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;It is impo&#383;&#383;ible to a&#383;&#383;ign a good
motive to any act of this literary intriguer.</p>
<p>&mdash;Perhaps, while they determined to e&#383;tabli&#383;h
their faction by "braving all Europe," they might think it equally
politic to perplex and overawe Paris by a near and dangerous enemy,
which would render their continuance in power nece&#383;&#383;ary,
or whom they might join, if expelled from it.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This la&#383;t rea&#383;on might afterwards have
given way to their apprehen&#383;ions, and the Bri&#383;&#383;otins
have preferred the creation of new civil wars, to a confidence in
the royali&#383;ts. The&#383;e men, who condemned the King for a
&#383;uppo&#383;ed intention of defending an authority
tran&#383;mitted to him through whole ages, and recently
&#383;anctioned by the voice of the people, did not &#383;cruple to
excite a civil war in defence of their &#383;ix month&#383;'
&#383;overeignty over a republic, proclaimed by a ferocious
comedian, and certainly without the a&#383;&#383;ent of the nation.
Had the ill-fated Monarch dared thus to trifle with the lives of
his &#383;ubjects, he might have &#383;aved France and him&#383;elf
from ruin.</blockquote>

<p>When men gratify their ambition by means &#383;o &#383;anguinary
and atrocious a&#383; tho&#383;e re&#383;orted to by the
Bri&#383;&#383;otines, we are authorized in concluding they will
not be more &#383;crupulous in the u&#383;e or pre&#383;ervation of
power, than they were in attaining it; and we can have no doubt but
that the fomenting or &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ing the progre&#383;s
of civil di&#383;cord, was, with them, a mere que&#383;tion of
expediency.</p>
<p>The decree which took place in March, 1793, for rai&#383;ing
three hundred thou&#383;and men in the departments, changed the
partial in&#383;urrections of La Vendee to an open and connected
rebellion; and every where the young people refu&#383;ed going, and
joined in preference the &#383;tandard of revolt. In the beginning
of the &#383;ummer, the brigand&#383;* (as they were called) grew
&#383;o numerous, that the government, now in the hands of
Robe&#383;pierre and hi&#383; party, began to take &#383;erious
mea&#383;ures to combat them.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Robber&#383;&mdash;<i>banditti</i>&mdash;The name was
fir&#383;t given, probably, to the in&#383;urgents of La Vendee, in
order to in&#383;inuate a belief that the di&#383;orders were but
of a &#383;light and predatory nature.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;One body of troops were di&#383;patched after another,
who were all &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively defeated, and every where
fled before the royali&#383;ts.</p>
<p>It is not unu&#383;ual in political concerns to attribute to
deep-laid plan&#383; and ab&#383;tru&#383;e combinations, effects
which are the natural re&#383;ult of private pa&#383;&#383;ions and
i&#383;olated intere&#383;ts. Robe&#383;pierre is &#383;aid to have
promoted both the de&#383;truction of the republican armies and
tho&#383;e of La Vendee, in order to reduce the national
population. That he was capable of imagining &#383;uch a project is
probable&mdash;yet we need not, in tracing the conduct of the war,
look farther than to the character of the agents who were,
almo&#383;t nece&#383;&#383;arily, employed in it. Nearly every
officer qualified for the command of an army, had either emigrated,
or was on &#383;ervice at the frontiers; and the ta&#383;k of
reducing by violence a people who re&#383;i&#383;ted only
becau&#383;e they deemed them&#383;elves injured, and who, even in
the e&#383;timation of the republicans, could only be
mi&#383;taken, was naturally avoided by all men who were not mere
adventurers. It might likewi&#383;e be the policy of the government
to prefer the &#383;ervices of tho&#383;e, who, having neither
reputation nor property, would be more dependent, and whom, whether
they became dangerous by their &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es or defeats,
it would be ea&#383;y to &#383;acrifice.</p>
<p>Either, then, from nece&#383;&#383;ity or choice, the republican
armies in La Vendee were conducted by di&#383;&#383;olute and
rapacious wretches, at all time&#383; more eager to pillage than
fight, and who were engaged in &#383;ecuring their plunder, when
they &#383;hould have been in pur&#383;uit of the enemy. On every
occa&#383;ion they &#383;eemed to retreat, that their ill
&#383;ucce&#383;s might afford them a pretext for declaring that
the next town or village was confederated with the in&#383;urgents,
and for delivering it up, in con&#383;equence, to murder and
rapine. Such of the &#383;oldiers as could fill their pocket-books
with a&#383;&#383;ignats, left their le&#383;s
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful companions, and retired as invalid&#383;
to the ho&#383;pitals: the battalions of Paris (and particularly
"the conquerors of the Ba&#383;tille") had &#383;uch ardour for
pillage, that every per&#383;on po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of
property was, in their &#383;en&#383;e, an ari&#383;tocrat, whom it
was lawful to de&#383;poil.*</p>

Paris were entirely loaded with their booty." Report of Benaben,
Commi&#383;&#383;ioner of the Department of Maine and
Loire.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;The carriages of the army were entirely appropriated to
the conveyance of their booty; till, at la&#383;t, the
admini&#383;trators of &#383;ome department&#383; were under the
nece&#383;&#383;ity of forbidding &#383;uch incumbrances: but the
officers, with whom re&#383;trictions of this &#383;ort were
unavailing, put all the hor&#383;es and waggons of the country in
requi&#383;ition for &#383;imilar purpo&#383;es, while they relaxed
them&#383;elves from the &#383;erious bu&#383;ine&#383;s of the
war, (which indeed was nearly confined to burning, plundering, and
ma&#383;&#383;acring the defencele&#383;s inhabitants,) by a
numerous retinue of mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es and
mu&#383;icians.</p>
<p>It is not &#383;urprizing that generals and troops of this
de&#383;cription were con&#383;tantly defeated; and their
reiterated di&#383;a&#383;ters might probably have fir&#383;t
&#383;ugge&#383;ted the idea of totally exterminating a people it
was found &#383;o difficult to &#383;ubdue, and &#383;o
impracticable to conciliate.&mdash;On the fir&#383;t of October
1793, Barrere, after inveighing again&#383;t the
exce&#383;&#383;ive population of La Vendee, which he termed
"frightful," propo&#383;ed to the Convention to proclaim by a
decree, that the war of La Vendee "&#383;hould be terminated" by
the twentieth of the &#383;ame month. The Convention, with
barbarous folly, obeyed; and the enlightened Pari&#383;ians,
accu&#383;tomed to think with contempt on the ignorance of the
Vendeans, believed that a war, which had baffled the efforts of
government for &#383;o many months, wa&#383; to end on a
preci&#383;e day&mdash;which Barrere had fixed with as much
a&#383;&#383;urance as though he had only been ordering a fete.</p>
<p>But the Convention and the government under&#383;tood this
decree in a very different &#383;en&#383;e from the good people of
Paris. The war was, indeed, to be ended; not by the u&#383;ual mode
of combating armies, but by a total extinction of all the
inhabitants of the country, both innocent and guilty&mdash;and
Merlin de Thionville, with other members, &#383;o perfectly
comprehended this dete&#383;table project, that they already began
to devi&#383;e &#383;chemes for repeopling La Vendee, when its
mi&#383;erable natives &#383;hould be de&#383;troyed.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It is for the credit of humanity to believe, that the
decree wa&#383; not under&#383;tood according to its real
intention; but the nation ha&#383; to choo&#383;e between the
imputation of cruelty, &#383;tupidity, or &#383;lavery&mdash; for
they either approved the &#383;en&#383;e of the decree, believed
what wa&#383; not po&#383;&#383;ible, or were obliged to put on an
appearance of both, in &#383;pite of their &#383;en&#383;es and
their feelings. A proclamation, in con&#383;equence, to the army,
is more explicit&mdash;"All the brigands of La Vendee mu&#383;t be
exterminated before the end of October."</blockquote>

<p>From this time, the repre&#383;entatives on mi&#383;&#383;ion,
commi&#383;&#383;aries of war, officers, &#383;oldiers, and agents
of every kind, vied with each other in the mo&#383;t abominable
outrages. Carrier &#383;uperintended the fu&#383;illades and
noyades at Nantes, while Lequinio di&#383;patched with his own
hands a part of the pri&#383;oners taken at La Fontenay, and
projected the de&#383;truction of the re&#383;t.&mdash;After the
evacuation of Mans by the in&#383;urgents, women were brought by
twenties and thirties, and &#383;hot before the hou&#383;e where
the deputie&#383; Tureau and Bourbotte had taken up their
re&#383;idence; and it appears to have been con&#383;idered as a
compliment to the&#383;e republican Molochs, to &#383;urround their
habitation with mountains of the dead. A compliment of the like
nature was paid to the repre&#383;entative Prieur de la Marne,* by
a volunteer, who having learned that his own brother was taken
among&#383;t the enemy, reque&#383;ted, by way of recommending
him&#383;elf to notice, a formal permi&#383;&#383;ion to be his
executioner.&mdash;The Roman &#383;toici&#383;m of Prieur accepted
the implied homage, and granted the reque&#383;t!!</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This repre&#383;entative, who was al&#383;o a member
of the Committee of Public Welfare, was not only the Brutus, but
the Antony of La Vendee; for we learn from the report of Benaben,
that his &#383;tern virtues were accompanied, through the whole of
his mi&#383;&#383;ion in thi&#383; afflicted country, by a cortege
of thirty &#383;trolling fiddler&#383;!</blockquote>

<p>Fourteen hundred pri&#383;oners, who had &#383;urrendered at
Savenay, among whom were many women and children, were &#383;hot,

Richard, Choudieu, Carpentier, and others of their colleagues,
&#383;et an example of rapine and cruelty, but too zealou&#383;ly
imitated by their &#383;ubordinate agents. In &#383;ome places, the
inhabitants, without di&#383;tinction of age or &#383;ex, were put
indi&#383;criminately to the &#383;word; in others, they were
forced to carry the pillage collected from their own dwellings,

<p>The in&#383;urgents had lo&#383;t Cholet, Chatillon, Mortagne,
&amp;c. Yet, far from being vanqui&#383;hed by the day appointed,
they had cro&#383;&#383;ed the Loire in great force, and, having
traver&#383;ed Brittany, were preparing to make an attack on
Granville. But this did not prevent Barrere from announcing to the
convention, that La Vendee was no more, and the galleries echoed
with applau&#383;es, when they were told that the highways were
impa&#383;&#383;able, from the numbers of the dead, and that a
con&#383;iderable part of France was one va&#383;t cemetery. This
intelligence al&#383;o tranquillized the paternal &#383;olicitude
of the legi&#383;lature, and, for many months, while the
&#383;y&#383;tem of depopulation was pur&#383;ued with the
mo&#383;t barbarous fury, it was not permi&#383;&#383;ible even to
&#383;u&#383;pect that the war was yet unextingui&#383;hed.</p>
<p>It is only &#383;ince the trial of the Nantais, that the
&#383;tate of La Vendee has again become a &#383;ubject of
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion: truth has now forced its way, and we
learn, that, whatever may be the &#383;trength of the&#383;e
unhappy people, their minds, embittered by &#383;uffering, and
animated by revenge, are &#383;till le&#383;s than ever
di&#383;po&#383;ed to &#383;ubmit to the republican government. The
de&#383;ign of total extirpation, once &#383;o much
in&#383;i&#383;ted on, is at pre&#383;ent &#383;aid to be
relinqui&#383;hed, and a plan of in&#383;truction and
conver&#383;ion is to be &#383;ub&#383;tituted for bayonets and
conflagrations. The revolted countries are to be enlightened by the
doctrines of liberty, fanatici&#383;m is to be expo&#383;ed, and a
love of the republic to &#383;ucceed the prejudices in favour of
Kings and Nobles.&mdash;To promote the&#383;e objects, is,
undoubtedly, the real intere&#383;t of the Convention; but a
morali&#383;t, who ob&#383;erves through another medium, may
compare with regret and indignation the in&#383;tructors with the
people they are to illumine, and the advantages of philo&#383;ophy
over ignorance.</p>
<p>Lequinio, one of the mo&#383;t determined reformers of the
barbari&#383;m of La Vendee, propo&#383;es two methods: the
fir&#383;t is, a general ma&#383;&#383;acre of all the
native&#383;&mdash;and the only objection it &#383;eems
&#383;u&#383;ceptible of in his opinion is, their numbers; but as
he thinks on this account it may be attended with difficulty, he is
for e&#383;tabli&#383;hing a &#383;ort of perpetual
mi&#383;&#383;ion of Repre&#383;entatives, who, by the influence of
good living and a company of fiddlers and &#383;ingers, are to
re&#383;tore the whole country to peace.*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*"The only difficulty that pre&#383;ents it&#383;elf
is, to determine whether recour&#383;e &#383;hall be had to the
alternative of indulgence, or if it will not be more advantageous
to per&#383;i&#383;t in the plan of total de&#383;truction. "If the
people that &#383;till remain were not more than thirty or forty
thou&#383;and, the &#383;horte&#383;t way would doubtle&#383;s be,
to cut all their throats (egorger), agreeably to my fir&#383;t
opinion; but the population is immen&#383;e, amounting &#383;till
to four hundred thou&#383;and &#383;ouls.&mdash;If there were no
hope of &#383;ucceeding by any other methods, certainly it were
better to kill all (egorger), even were there five hundred
thou&#383;and. "But what are we to under&#383;tand by mea&#383;ures
of rigour? Is there no di&#383;tinction to be made between rigorous
and barbarous mea&#383;ures? The utmo&#383;t &#383;everity is
ju&#383;tified on the plea of the general good, but nothing can
ju&#383;tify barbarity. If the welfare of France
nece&#383;&#383;itated the &#383;acrifice of the four hundred
thou&#383;and inhabitant&#383; of La Vendee, and the countries in
rebellion adjoining, they ought to be &#383;acrificed: but, even in
this ca&#383;e, there would be no excu&#383;e for tho&#383;e
atrocities which revolt nature, which are an outrage to &#383;ocial
order, and repugnant equally to feeling (&#383;entiment) and
rea&#383;on; and in cutting off &#383;o many entire generations for
the good of the country, we ought not to &#383;uffer the u&#383;e
of barbarous means in a &#383;ingle in&#383;tance. "Now the
mo&#383;t effectual way to arrive at this end (converting the
people), would be by joyous and fraternal mi&#383;&#383;ions, frank
and familiar harangues, civic repa&#383;ts, and, above all,
dancing. "I could wi&#383;h, too, that during their circuits in
the&#383;e countries, the Repre&#383;entatives were always attended
by mu&#383;icians. The expence would be trifling, compared with the
good effect; if, as I am &#383;trongly per&#383;uaded, we could
thus &#383;ucceed in giving a turn to the public mind, and
clo&#383;e the bleeding arteries of the&#383;e fertile and unhappy
provinces." Lequinio, Guerre de La Vendee. And this people, who
were either to have their throats cut, or be republicanized by
means of &#383;inging, dancing, and revolutionary Pan&#383; and
Silenu&#383;'s, already beheld their property deva&#383;tated by
pillage or conflagration, and were in danger of a pe&#383;tilence
from the unburied bodies of their families.&mdash;Let the reader,
who has &#383;een Lequinio's pamphlet, compare his account of the
&#383;ufferings of the Vendeans, and his project for conciliating
them. They convey a &#383;trong idea of the levity of the national
character; but, in thi&#383; in&#383;tance, I mu&#383;t
&#383;uppo&#383;e, that nature would be &#383;uperior to local
influence; and I doubt if Lequinio's jocund philo&#383;ophy will
ever &#383;ucceed in attaching the Vendeans to the
republic.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;Camille De&#383;mouins, a republican reformer, nearly as
&#383;anguinary, though not more liberal, thought the guillotine
di&#383;graced by &#383;uch ignorant prey, and that it were better
to hunt them down like wild bea&#383;ts; or, if made
pri&#383;oners, to exchange them again&#383;t the cattle of their
country!&mdash;The eminently informed Herault de Sechelles was the
patron and confidant of the exterminating reforms of Carrier; and
Carnot, when the mode of reforming by noyades and fu&#383;illades
was debated at the Committee, pleaded the cau&#383;e of Carrier,
whom he de&#383;cribes as a good, nay, an excellent
patriot.&mdash;Merlin de Thionville, who&#383;e philo&#383;ophy is
of a more martial ca&#383;t, was de&#383;irous that the natives of
La Vendee &#383;hould be completely annihilated, in order to
furni&#383;h in their territory and habitations a recompence for
the armies.&mdash;Almo&#383;t every member of the Convention
ha&#383; individually avowed principles, or committed acts, from
which common turpitude would recoil, and, as a legi&#383;lative
body, their whole code ha&#383; been one unvarying
&#383;ubver&#383;ion of morals and humanity. Such are the men who
value them&#383;elves on po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing all the
advantages the Vendeans are pretended to be in want of.&mdash;We
will now examine what di&#383;ciples they have produced, and the
benefits which have been derived from their in&#383;tructions.</p>
<p>Every part of France remarkable for an early
pro&#383;elyti&#383;m to the revolutionary doctrines has been the
theatre of crimes unparalleled in the annals of human nature.
Tho&#383;e who have mo&#383;t boa&#383;ted their contempt for
religious &#383;uper&#383;tition have been degraded by an idolatry
as gro&#383;s a&#383; any ever practiced on the Nile; and the
mo&#383;t enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic republican&#383; have, without
daring to murmur, &#383;ubmitted for two years
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively to a horde of cruel and immoral
tyrants.&mdash;A pretended enfranchi&#383;ement from political and
eccle&#383;ia&#383;tical &#383;lavery has been the &#383;ignal of
the lowe&#383;t deba&#383;ement, and the mo&#383;t cruel
profligacy: the very Catechumens of freedom and philo&#383;ophy
have, while yet in their fir&#383;t rudiments,
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed them&#383;elves as proficients in the arts
of oppre&#383;&#383;ion and &#383;ervility, of intolerance and
licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s.&mdash;Paris, the rendezvous of all the
per&#383;ecuted patriots and philo&#383;ophers in Europe, the
centre of the revolutionary &#383;y&#383;tem, who&#383;e
inhabitants were illumined by the fir&#383;t ray&#383; of modern
republicani&#383;m, and who claim a &#383;ort of property in the
right&#383; of man, as being the original inventors, may fairly be
quoted as an example of the benefits that would accrue from a
farther di&#383;&#383;emination of the new tenets.</p>
<p>Without reverting to the events of Augu&#383;t and September,
1792, pre&#383;ided by the founders of liberty, and executed by
their too apt &#383;ectaries, it is notorious that the legions of
Paris, &#383;ent to cha&#383;ti&#383;e the unenlightened Vendeans,
were the mo&#383;t cruel and rapacious banditti that ever were let
loo&#383;e to afflict the world. Yet, while they exerci&#383;ed
thi&#383; &#383;avage oppre&#383;&#383;ion in the countries near
the Loire, their fellow-citizen&#383; on the banks of the Seine
crouched at the frown of paltry tyrants, and were
unre&#383;i&#383;tingly dragged to dungeons, or butchered by
hundreds on the &#383;caffold.&mdash;At Mar&#383;eilles, Lyons,
Bourdeaux, Arras, wherever the&#383;e baleful principles have made
converts, they have made criminals and victims; and tho&#383;e who
have been mo&#383;t eager in imbibing or propagating them have, by
a natural and ju&#383;t retribution, been the fir&#383;t
&#383;acrificed. The new di&#383;coveries in politics have produced
&#383;ome in ethics not le&#383;s novel, and until the adoption of
revolutionary doctrines, the extent of human
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion or human depravity was fortunately
unknown.</p>
<p>In this &#383;ource of guilt and mi&#383;ery the people of La
Vendee are now to be in&#383;tructed&mdash;that people, who are
acknowledged to be ho&#383;pitable, humane, and laborious, and
who&#383;e ideas of freedom may be better e&#383;timated by their
re&#383;i&#383;tance to a de&#383;poti&#383;m which the re&#383;t
of France has &#383;unk under, than by the jargon of pretended
reformers.&mdash;I could wi&#383;h, that not only the pea&#383;ants
of La Vendee, but tho&#383;e of all other countries, might for ever
remain &#383;trangers to &#383;uch pernicious knowledge. It is
&#383;ufficient for this u&#383;eful cla&#383;s of men to be taught
the &#383;imple precepts of religion and morality, and tho&#383;e
who would teach them more, are not their benefactors. Our age is,
indeed, a literary age, and &#383;uch pur&#383;uits are both
liberal and laudable in the rich and idle; but why &#383;hould
volumes of politics or philo&#383;ophy be mutilated and frittered
into pamphlets, to in&#383;pire a di&#383;gu&#383;t for labour, and
a ta&#383;te for &#383;tudy or plea&#383;ure, in tho&#383;e to whom
&#383;uch di&#383;gu&#383;ts or inclinations are fatal. The
&#383;pirit of one author i&#383; extracted, and the beauties of
another are &#383;elected, only to bewilder the under&#383;tanding,
and engro&#383;s the time, of tho&#383;e who might be more
profitably employed.</p>
<p>I know I may be cen&#383;ured as illiberal; but I have, during
my abode in this country, &#383;ufficiently witne&#383;&#383;ed the
di&#383;a&#383;trous effects of corrupting a people through their

<h2>Amiens, Oct. 24, 1794.</h2>
<p>Revolutions, like every thing el&#383;e in France, are a mode,
and the Convention already commemorate four &#383;ince 1789: that
of July 1789, which rendered the monarchical power nugatory; that
of Augu&#383;t the 10th, 1792, which &#383;ubverted it; the
expul&#383;ion of the Bri&#383;&#383;otins, in May 1793; and the
death of Robe&#383;pierre, in July 1794.</p>
<p>The people, accu&#383;tomed, from their earlie&#383;t knowledge,
to re&#383;pect the per&#383;on and authority of the King, felt
that the events of the two fir&#383;t epochs, which di&#383;graced
the one and annihilated the other, were violent and important
revolutions; and, as language which expre&#383;&#383;es the public
&#383;entiment is readily adopted, it &#383;oon became u&#383;ual
to &#383;peak of the&#383;e events as the revolutions of July and
Augu&#383;t.</p>
<p>The thirty-fir&#383;t of May has always been viewed in a very
different light, for it was not ea&#383;y to make the people at
large comprehend how the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ion of
Robe&#383;pierre and Danton to Bri&#383;&#383;ot and Roland could
be con&#383;idered as a revolution, more e&#383;pecially as it
appeared evident that the principles of one party actuated the
government of the other. Every town had its many-headed
mon&#383;ter to repre&#383;ent the defeat of the Foederali&#383;ts,
and its mountain to proclaim the triumph of their enemie&#383; the
Mountaineers; but the&#383;e political hieroglyphics were little
under&#383;tood, and the merits of the factions they alluded to
little di&#383;tingui&#383;hed&mdash;&#383;o that the revolution of
the thirty-fir&#383;t of May wa&#383; rather a party aera, than a
popular one.</p>
<p>The fall of Robe&#383;pierre would have made as little
impre&#383;&#383;ion as that of the Girondi&#383;ts, if &#383;ome
melioration of the revolutionary &#383;y&#383;tem had not
&#383;ucceeded it; and it is in fact only &#383;ince the public
voice, and the intere&#383;t of the Convention, have
occa&#383;ioned a change approaching to reform, that the death of
Robe&#383;pierre is really con&#383;idered as a benefit.</p>
<p>But what was in it&#383;elf no more than a warfare of factions,
may now, if e&#383;timated by its con&#383;equences, be pronounced
a revolution of infinite importance. The Jacobins, whom their
declining power only rendered more in&#383;olent and daring, have
at length obliged the Convention to take decided mea&#383;ures
again&#383;t them, and they are now &#383;ubject to &#383;uch
regulations as mu&#383;t effectually dimini&#383;h their influence,
and, in the end, di&#383;&#383;olve their whole combination. They
can no longer corre&#383;pond a&#383; &#383;ocieties, and the
mi&#383;chievous union which con&#383;tituted their chief force,
can &#383;carcely be &#383;upported for any time under the
pre&#383;ent re&#383;trictions.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* "All affiliations, aggregations, and foederations, as
well a&#383; corre&#383;pondences carried on collectively between
&#383;ocieties, under whatever denomination they may exi&#383;t,
are henceforth prohibited, a&#383; being &#383;ubver&#383;ive of
government, and contrary to the unity of the republic. "Tho&#383;e
per&#383;ons who &#383;ign as pre&#383;idents or &#383;ecretaries,
petitions or addre&#383;&#383;es in a collective form, &#383;hall
be arre&#383;ted and confined a&#383; &#383;u&#383;picious, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&mdash;Whoever offends in any &#383;hape again&#383;t the
pre&#383;ent law, will incur the &#383;ame penalty." The whole of
the decree is in the &#383;ame &#383;pirit. The immediate and
avowed pretext for this mea&#383;ure was, that the popular
&#383;ocieties, who have of late only &#383;ent petitions
di&#383;agreeable to the Convention, did not expre&#383;s the
&#383;en&#383;e of the people. Yet the depo&#383;ition of the King,
and the e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of the republic, had no other
&#383;anction than the adherence of the&#383;e clubs, who are now
allowed not to be the nation, and who&#383;e very exi&#383;tence as
then con&#383;tituted is declared to be &#383;ubver&#383;ive of
government.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not improbable, that the Convention, by &#383;uffering the
clubs &#383;till to exi&#383;t, after reducing them to nullity, may
hope to pre&#383;erve the in&#383;titution as a future
re&#383;ource again&#383;t the people, while it
repre&#383;&#383;e&#383; their immediate efforts again&#383;t
it&#383;elf. The Bri&#383;&#383;otins would have attempted a
&#383;imilar policy, but they had nothing to oppo&#383;e to the
Jacobins, except their per&#383;onal influence. Bri&#383;&#383;ot
and Roland took part with the clubs, as they approved the
ma&#383;&#383;acres of Augu&#383;t and September, ju&#383;t as far
as it an&#383;wered their purpo&#383;e; and when they were
abandoned by the one, and the other were found to incur an
unprofitable odium, they acted the part which Tallien and Freron
act now under the &#383;ame circum&#383;tances, and would willingly
have promoted the de&#383;truction of a power which had become
inimical to them.*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Bri&#383;&#383;ot and Roland were more pernicious as
Jacobins than the mo&#383;t furious of their
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ors. If they did not in per&#383;on excite
the people to the commi&#383;&#383;ion of crimes, they corrupted
them, and made them fit in&#383;truments for the crimes of others.
Bri&#383;&#383;ot might affect to condemn the ma&#383;&#383;acres
of September in the gro&#383;s, but he is known to have enquired
with eager impatience, and in a tone which implied he had
rea&#383;ons for expecting it, whether De Morande, an enemy he
wi&#383;hed to be relea&#383;ed from, was among the
murdered.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Their imitators, without po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing
more hone&#383;ty, either political or moral, are more fortunate;
and not only Tallien and Freron, who &#383;ince their
expul&#383;ion from the Jacobins have become their mo&#383;t active
enemies, are now in a manner popular, but even the whole Convention
is much le&#383;&#383; dete&#383;ted than it was before.</p>
<p>It is the &#383;ingular felicity of the A&#383;&#383;embly to
derive a &#383;ort of popularity from the very exce&#383;&#383;es
it has occa&#383;ioned or &#383;anctioned, and which, it was
natural to &#383;uppo&#383;e, would have con&#383;igned it for ever
to vengeance or obloquy; but the pa&#383;t &#383;ufferings of the
people have taught them to be moderate in their expectations; and
the name of their repre&#383;entation has been &#383;o connected
with tyranny of every &#383;ort, that it appears an extraordinary
forbearance when the u&#383;ual operations of guillotines and
mandates of arre&#383;t are &#383;u&#383;pended.</p>
<p>Thus, though the Convention have not in effect repaired a
thou&#383;andth part of their own acts of inju&#383;tice, or done
any good except from nece&#383;&#383;ity, they are overwhelmed with
applauding addre&#383;&#383;es, and affectionate injunctions not to
quit their po&#383;t. What is &#383;till more wonderful, many of
the&#383;e are &#383;incere; and Tallien, Freron, Legendre, &amp;c.
with all their revolutionary enormities on their heads, are now the
heroes of the reviving ari&#383;tocrats.</p>
<p>Situated as things are at pre&#383;ent, there is much &#383;ound
policy in flattering the Convention into a proper u&#383;e of their
power, rather than making a convul&#383;ive effort to deprive them
of it. The Jacobins would doubtle&#383;s avail them&#383;elves of
&#383;uch a movement; and this is &#383;o much apprehended, that it
has given ri&#383;e to a general though tacit agreement to foment
the divi&#383;ions between the Legi&#383;lature and the Clubs, and
to &#383;upport the fir&#383;t, at lea&#383;t until it &#383;hall
have de&#383;troyed the latter.</p>
<p>The late decrees, which ob&#383;truct the intercour&#383;e and
affiliation of popular &#383;ocieties, may be regarded as an event
not only beneficial to this country, but to the world in general;
becau&#383;e it is confe&#383;&#383;ed, that the&#383;e
combinations, by means of which the French monarchy was
&#383;ubverted, and the King brought to the &#383;caffold, are only
reconcileable with a barbarous and anarchical government.</p>
<p>The Convention are now much occupied on two affairs, which call
forth all their "natural propen&#383;ities," and afford a farther
confirmation of thi&#383; fact&mdash;that their feelings and
principles are always in&#383;tinctively at war with ju&#383;tice,
however they may find it expedient to affect a regard for
it&mdash;<i>C'e&#383;t la chatte metamorpho&#383;ee en femme</i>

<p>The Deputies who were impri&#383;oned as accomplices of the
Girondi&#383;ts, and on other different pretexts, have petitioned
either to be brought to trial or relea&#383;ed; and the abominable
conduct of Carrier at Nantes is &#383;o fully
&#383;ub&#383;tantiated, that the whole country is impatient to
have &#383;ome &#383;tep&#383; taken towards bringing him to
puni&#383;hment: yet the Convention are aver&#383;e from both
the&#383;e mea&#383;ure&#383;&mdash;they procra&#383;tinate and
elude the demand of their &#383;eventy-two colleagues, who were
arre&#383;ted without a &#383;pecific charge; while they
almo&#383;t protect Carrier, and declare, that in ca&#383;e&#383;
which tend to deprive a Repre&#383;entative of his liberty, it is
better to reflect thirty times than once. This is curious doctrine
with men who have &#383;ent &#383;o many people arbitrarily to the
&#383;caffold, and who now detain &#383;eventy-two Deputies in
confinement, they know not why.</p>
<p>The a&#383;hes of Rou&#383;&#383;eau have recently been
depo&#383;ited with the &#383;ame ceremonies, and in the &#383;ame
place, as tho&#383;e of Marat. We &#383;hould feel for &#383;uch a
degradation of genius, had not the talents of Rou&#383;&#383;eau
been frequently mi&#383;applied; and it is their
mi&#383;application which has levelled him to an
a&#383;&#383;ociation with Marat. Rou&#383;&#383;eau might be
really a fanatic, and, though eccentric, hone&#383;t; yet his power
of adorning impracticable &#383;y&#383;tems, it mu&#383;t be
acknowledged, has been more mi&#383;chievous to &#383;ociety than a
thou&#383;and &#383;uch gro&#383;s impo&#383;tors as Marat.</p>
<p>I have learned &#383;ince my return from the Providence, the
death of Madame Elizabeth. I was ill when it happened, and my
friends took &#383;ome pains to conceal an event which they knew
would affect me. In tracing the motive&#383; of the government for
this horrid action, it may perhaps be &#383;ufficiently accounted
for in the known piety and virtues of this Prince&#383;s; but
rea&#383;ons of another kind have been &#383;ugge&#383;ted to me,
and which, in all likelihood, contributed to ha&#383;ten it. She
was the only per&#383;on of the royal family of an age competent
for political tran&#383;actions who had not emigrated, and her
character extorted re&#383;pect even from her enemies. [The Prince
of Conti was too in&#383;ignificant to be an object of
jealou&#383;y in thi&#383; way.] She mu&#383;t therefore, of
cour&#383;e, &#383;ince the death of the Queen, have been an object
of jealou&#383;y to all parties. Robe&#383;pierre might fear that
&#383;he would be led to con&#383;ent to &#383;ome arrangement with
a rival faction for placing the King on the throne&mdash;the
Convention were under &#383;imilar apprehen&#383;ions with regard
to him; &#383;o that the fate of this illu&#383;triou&#383;
&#383;ufferer was probably gratifying to every part of the
republicans.</p>
<p>I find, on reading her trial, (if &#383;o it may be called,) a
repetition of one of the principal charges again&#383;t the
Queen&mdash;that of trampling on the national colours at
Ver&#383;ailles, during an entertainment given to &#383;ome
newly-arrived troops. Yet I have been a&#383;&#383;ured by two
gentlemen, perfectly informed on the &#383;ubject, and who were
totally unacquainted with each other, that this circum&#383;tance,
which has been &#383;o u&#383;efully enlarged upon, is fal&#383;e,*
and that the whole calumny originated in the jealou&#383;y of a
part of the national guard who had not been invited.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This infamous calumny (originally fabricated by
Lecointre the linen draper, then an officer of the National Guard,
now a member of the council of 500) was amply confuted by M.
Mounier, who wa&#383; Pre&#383;ident of the States-General at the
time, in a publication intitled "<i>Expo&#383;e de ma
Conduite,</i>" which appeared &#383;oon after the event&mdash;in
the autumn of 1789.&mdash;Editor.</blockquote>

<p>But this, as well as the taking of the Ba&#383;tille, and other
revolutionary fal&#383;ehoods, will, I tru&#383;t, be elucidated.
The people are now undeceived only by their
calamitie&#383;&mdash;the time may come, when it will be &#383;afe
to produce their conviction by truth. Heroes of the fourteenth of

<h2>Amiens, Nov. 2, 1794.</h2>
<p>Every po&#383;t now brings me letters from England; but I
perceive, by the &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed congratulations of my
friends, that, though they rejoice to find I am &#383;till alive,
they are far from thinking me in a &#383;tate of &#383;ecurity.
You, my dear Brother, mu&#383;t more particularly have lamented the
tedious confinement I have endured, and the inconveniencies to
which I have been &#383;ubjected; I am, however, per&#383;uaded
that you would not wi&#383;h me to have been exempt from a
per&#383;ecution in which all the natives of England, who are not a
di&#383;grace to their country, as well as &#383;ome that are
&#383;o, have &#383;hared. Such an exemption would now be deemed a
reproach; for, though it mu&#383;t be confe&#383;&#383;ed that few
of us have been voluntary &#383;ufferers, we &#383;till claim the
honour of martyrdom, and are not very tolerant towards tho&#383;e
who, expo&#383;ed by their &#383;ituation, may be
&#383;uppo&#383;ed to have owed their protection to their
principles.</p>
<p>There are, indeed, many known revolutioni&#383;ts and
republicans, who, from party di&#383;putes, per&#383;onal
jealou&#383;ies, or from being compri&#383;ed in &#383;ome general
mea&#383;ure, have undergone a &#383;hort impri&#383;onment; and
the&#383;e men now wi&#383;h to be confounded with their companions
who are of a different de&#383;cription. But &#383;uch per&#383;ons
are carefully di&#383;tingui&#383;hed;* and the ari&#383;tocrats
have, in their turn, a catalogue of &#383;u&#383;picious
people&mdash;that is, of people &#383;u&#383;pected of not having
been &#383;u&#383;picious.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Mr. Thomas Paine, for in&#383;tance,
notwith&#383;tanding his &#383;ufferings, i&#383; &#383;till
thought more worthy of a &#383;eat in the Convention or the
Jacobins, than of an apartment in the Luxembourg.&mdash;Indeed I
have generally remarked, that the French of all parties hold an
Engli&#383;h republican in peculiar abhorrence.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It is now the fa&#383;hion to talk of a &#383;ojourn in a
mai&#383;on d'arret with triumph; and the more decent people, who
from prudence or fear had been forced to &#383;eek refuge in the
Jacobin clubs, are now &#383;olicitous to proclaim their real
motives. The red cap no longer "rears its hideou&#383; front" by
day, but is mode&#383;tly converted into a night-cap; and the
bearer of a diplome de Jacobin, in&#383;tead of &#383;winging
along, to the annoyance of all the pa&#383;&#383;engers he meets,
paces &#383;oberly with a dimini&#383;hed height, and an air not
unlike what in England we call &#383;neaking. The bonnet rouge
begins likewi&#383;e to be effaced from flags at the doors; and, as
though this emblem of liberty were a very bad neighbour to
property, it&#383; relegation &#383;eems to encourage the
re-appearance of &#383;ilver forks and &#383;poons, which are
gradually drawn forth from their hiding-places, and re&#383;ume
their &#383;tations at table. The Jacobins repre&#383;ent
them&#383;elves a&#383; being under the mo&#383;t cruel
oppre&#383;&#383;ion, declare that the members of the Convention
are ari&#383;tocrats and royali&#383;ts, and lament bitterly, that,
in&#383;tead of fi&#383;h-women, or female patriots of republican
external, the galleries are filled with auditors in flounces and
anti-civic top-knots, femmes a fontanges.</p>
<p>The&#383;e imputations and grievances of the Jacobins are not
altogether without foundation. People in general are &#383;trongly
impre&#383;&#383;ed with an idea that the A&#383;&#383;embly are
veering towards royali&#383;m; and it is equally true, that the
&#383;peeches of Tallien and Freron are occa&#383;ionally heard and
applauded by fair elegantes, who, two years ago, would have
recoiled at the name of either. It is not that their former deeds
are forgotten, but the French are grown wi&#383;e by
&#383;uffering; and it is politic, when bad men act well, whatever
the motive, to give them credit for it, as nothing i&#383; &#383;o
likely to make them per&#383;evere, as the hope that their
reputation i&#383; yet retrievable. On this principle the
ari&#383;tocrats are the eulogi&#383;ts of Tallien, while the
Jacobins remind him hourly of the ma&#383;&#383;acres of the
prie&#383;ts, and his official conduct as Secretary to the
municipality or Paris.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Tallien was Seecretary to the Commune of Paris in
1792, and on the thirty-fir&#383;t of Augu&#383;t he appeared at
the bar of the Legi&#383;lative A&#383;&#383;embly with an
addre&#383;s, in which he told them "he had cau&#383;ed the
refractory prie&#383;ts to be arre&#383;ted and confined, and that
in a few days the Land of Liberty &#383;hould be freed of
them."&mdash;The ma&#383;&#383;acres of the pri&#383;ons began two
days after!</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As &#383;oon as a Repre&#383;entative is convicted of harbouring
an opinion unfavourable to pillage or murder, he is immediately
declared an ari&#383;tocrat; or, if the Convention happen for a
moment to be influenced by rea&#383;on or ju&#383;tice, the hopes
and fears of both parties are awakened by &#383;u&#383;picions that
the members are converts to royali&#383;m.&mdash;For my own part, I
believe they are and will be ju&#383;t what their per&#383;onal
&#383;ecurity and per&#383;onal intere&#383;t may
&#383;ugge&#383;t, though it is but a &#383;orry &#383;ort of
panegyric on republican ethics to conclude, that every one who
manife&#383;ts the lea&#383;t &#383;ymptom of probity or decency,
mu&#383;t of cour&#383;e be a royali&#383;t or an
ari&#383;tocrat.</p>
<p>Notwith&#383;tanding the harmony which appears to
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;t between the Convention and the people, the
former is much le&#383;s popular in detail than in the gro&#383;s.
Almo&#383;t every member who has been on mi&#383;&#383;ion, is
accu&#383;ed of dilapidations and cruelties &#383;o heinous, that,
if they had not been committed by Repre&#383;entans du Peuple, the
criminal courts would find no difficulty in deciding upon
them.&mdash;But as theft or murder does not deprive a member of his
privileges, complaints of this nature are only cognizable by the
A&#383;&#383;embly, which, being yet in its fir&#383;t days of
regeneration, is rather &#383;crupulous of defending &#383;uch
amu&#383;ements overtly. Alarmed, however, at the number, and
aver&#383;e from the precedent of the&#383;e denunciations, it has
now pa&#383;&#383;ed a variety of decrees, which are termed a
guarantee of the national repre&#383;entation, and which in fact
guarantee it &#383;o effectually, that a Deputy may do any thing in
future with impunity, provided it does not affect his colleagues.
There are now &#383;o many forms, reports, and examinations, that
&#383;everal months may be employed before the per&#383;on of a
delinquent, however notorious his guilt, can be &#383;ecured. The
exi&#383;tence of a fellow-creature &#383;hould, doubtle&#383;s, be
attacked with caution; for, though he may have forfeited his claims
on our e&#383;teem, and even our pity, religion has pre&#383;erved
him others, of which he &#383;hould not be deprived.&mdash;But when
we recollect that all the&#383;e merciful ceremonie&#383; are in
favour of a Carrier or a Le Bon, and that the King, Madame
Elizabeth, and thou&#383;ands of innocent people, were hurried to
execution, without being allowed the con&#383;olations of piety or
affection, which only a mockery of ju&#383;tice might have afforded
them; when, even now, prie&#383;t&#383; are guillotined for
celebrating ma&#383;&#383;es in private, and thoughtle&#383;s
people for &#383;peaking di&#383;re&#383;pectfully of the
Convention&mdash;the heart is at variance with religion and
principle, and we regret that mercy is to be the exclu&#383;ive
portion of tho&#383;e who were never acce&#383;&#383;ible to its
dictates.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The denunciation being fir&#383;t pre&#383;ented to
the A&#383;&#383;embly, they are to decide whether it &#383;hall be
received. If they determine in the affirmative, it is &#383;ent to
the three Committees of Legi&#383;lation, Public Welfare, and
General Safety, to report whether there may be room for farther
examination. In that ca&#383;e, a commi&#383;&#383;ion of
twenty-one members is appointed to receive the proofs of the
accu&#383;er, and the defence of the accu&#383;ed. The&#383;e
Commi&#383;&#383;ioners, after as long a delay as they may think
fit to interpo&#383;e, make known their opinion; and if it be
again&#383;t the accu&#383;ed, the Convention proceed to determine
finally whether the matter &#383;hall be referred to the ordinary
tribunal. All this time the culprit is at large, or, at wor&#383;t,
and merely for the form, carele&#383;&#383;ly guarded at his own
dwelling.</blockquote>

<h2>Ba&#383;&#383;e-ville, Arras, Nov. 6, 1794.</h2>
<p>Since my own liberation, I have been ince&#383;&#383;antly
employed in endeavouring to procure the return of my friends to
Amiens; who, though relea&#383;ed from pri&#383;on &#383;ome time,
could not obtain pa&#383;&#383;ports to quit Arras. After numerous
difficulties and vexations, we have at length &#383;ucceeded, and I
am now here to accompany them home.</p>
<p>I found Mr. and Mrs. D____ much altered by the hard&#383;hips
they have undergone: Mrs. D____, in particular, has been confined
&#383;ome months in a noi&#383;ome pri&#383;on called the
Providence, originally intended as a hou&#383;e of correction, and
in which, though built to contain an hundred and fifty
per&#383;ons, were crouded near five hundred females, chiefly
ladies of Arra&#383; and the environs.&mdash;The
&#383;uperintendance of this mi&#383;erable place wa&#383;
entru&#383;ted to a couple of vulgar and vicious women, who, having
di&#383;tingui&#383;hed them&#383;elves as patriots from the
beginning of the revolution, were now rewarded by Le Bon with an
office as profitable as it was congenial to their natures.</p>
<p>I know not whether it is to be imputed to the national
character, or to that of the French republicans only, but the
cruelties which have been committed are u&#383;ually &#383;o mixed
with licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s, as to preclude de&#383;cription. I
have already noticed the conduct of Le Bon, and it mu&#383;t
&#383;uffice to &#383;ay, his agents were worthy of him, and that
the female pri&#383;oners &#383;uffered every thing which
brutality, rapaciou&#383;ne&#383;s, and indecency, could inflict.
Mr. D____ was, in the mean time, tran&#383;ferred from pri&#383;on
to pri&#383;on&mdash;the di&#383;tre&#383;s of &#383;eparation was
augmented by their mutual apprehen&#383;ions and pecuniary
embarra&#383;&#383;ment&#383;&mdash;and I much fear, the health and
&#383;pirits of both are irretrievably injured.</p>
<p>I regret my impatience in coming here, rather than waiting the
arrival of my friends at home; for the changes I ob&#383;erve, and
the recollections they give birth to, oppre&#383;s my heart, and
render the place hateful to me.&mdash;All the families I knew are
dimini&#383;hed by executions, and their property i&#383;
confi&#383;cated&mdash;tho&#383;e whom I left in elegant hotels are
now in ob&#383;cure lodgings, &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ting upon the
&#383;uperfluities of better day&#383;&mdash;and the &#383;orrows
of the widows and orphans are increa&#383;ed by penury; while the
Convention, which affects to condemn the crimes of Le Bon, is
profiting by the &#383;poils of his victims.</p>
<p>I am the more deeply impre&#383;&#383;ed by the&#383;e
circum&#383;tances, becau&#383;e, when I was here in 1792,
&#383;everal who have thus fallen, though they had nothing to
reproach them&#383;elves with, were yet &#383;o much intimidated as
to propo&#383;e emigrating; and I then was of opinion, that
&#383;uch a &#383;tep would be impolitic and unnece&#383;&#383;ary.
I hope and believe this opinion did not influence them, but I
lament having given it, for the event has proved that a great part
of the emigrants are ju&#383;tifiable. It always appeared to me
&#383;o &#383;erious and great an evil to abandon one's country,
that when I have &#383;een it done with indifference or levity, I
may perhaps have &#383;ometimes tran&#383;ferred to the
mea&#383;ure it&#383;elf a &#383;entiment of di&#383;approbation,
excited originally by the manner of its adoption. When I &#383;aw
people expatiate with calmne&#383;s, and heard them &#383;peak of
it as a mean&#383; of di&#383;tingui&#383;hing them&#383;elves, I
did not &#383;ufficiently allow for the tendency of the French to
make the be&#383;t of every thing, or the influence of vanity on
men who allow it to make part of the national characteri&#383;tic:
and &#383;urely, if ever vanity were laudable, that of marking a
dete&#383;tation for revolutionary principles, and an attachment to
loyalty and religion, may ju&#383;tly be con&#383;idered &#383;o.
Many whom I then accu&#383;ed of being too lightly affected by the
pro&#383;pect of exile, might be animated by the hope of
per&#383;onally contributing to the e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of
peace and order, and re&#383;cuing their country from the banditti
who were oppre&#383;&#383;ing it; and it is not
&#383;urpri&#383;ing that &#383;uch objects &#383;hould dazzle the
imagination and deceive the judgment in the choice of mea&#383;ures
by which they were to be obtained.</p>
<p>The number of emigrants from fa&#383;hion or caprice is probably
not great; and whom &#383;hall we now dare to include under this
de&#383;cription, when the humble artizan, the laborious
pea&#383;ant, and the village prie&#383;t, have en&#383;anguined
the &#383;caffold de&#383;tined for the prince or the
prelate?&mdash;But if the emigrants be ju&#383;tifiable, the
refugees are yet more &#383;o.</p>
<p>By Emigrants, I mean all who, without being immediately in
danger, left their country through apprehen&#383;ion of the
future&mdash;from attachment to the per&#383;ons of the Princes, or
to join companions in the army whom they might deem it a
di&#383;grace to abandon.&mdash;Tho&#383;e whom I think may with
truth be &#383;tyled Refugees, are the Nobility and Prie&#383;ts
who fled when the people, irritated by the literary terrori&#383;ts
of the day, the Bri&#383;&#383;ots, Rolands, Camille
De&#383;moulins, &amp;c. were burning their chateaux and
pro&#383;cribing their per&#383;ons, and in whom expatriation
cannot properly be deemed the effect of choice. The&#383;e,
wherever they have &#383;ought an a&#383;ylum, are entitled to our
re&#383;pect and &#383;ympathy.</p>
<p>Yet, I repeat, we are not authorized to di&#383;criminate. There
is no rea&#383;oning coldly on the &#383;ubject. The mo&#383;t
cautious prudence, the mo&#383;t liberal &#383;acrifices, and the
meane&#383;t conde&#383;cen&#383;ions, have not in&#383;ured the
lives and fortunes of tho&#383;e who ventured to remain; and I know
not that the ab&#383;ent require any other apology than the
de&#383;olation of the country they have quitted. Had my friends
who have been &#383;laughtered by Le Bon'&#383; tribunal
per&#383;i&#383;ted in endeavouring to e&#383;cape, they might have
lived, and their families, though de&#383;poiled by the rapacity of
the government, have been comparatively happy.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The fir&#383;t horrors of the revolution are well
known, and I have &#383;een no accounts which exaggerate them. The
niece of a lady of my acquaintance, a young woman only
&#383;eventeen, e&#383;caped from her country-hou&#383;e
(whil&#383;t already in flames) with her infant at her brea&#383;t,
and literally without clothes to cover her. In this &#383;tate
&#383;he wandered a whole night, and when &#383;he at length
reached a place where &#383;he procured a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance,
was &#383;o exhau&#383;ted that her life was in
danger.&mdash;Another lady, whom I knew, was wounded in the arm by
&#383;ome pea&#383;ants a&#383;&#383;embled to force from her the
writings of her hu&#383;band'&#383; e&#383;tates. Even after this
they &#383;till remained in France, &#383;ubmitted with
cheerfulne&#383;s to all the demands of patriotic gifts, forced
loans, requi&#383;itions and impo&#383;itions of every kind; yet
her hu&#383;band was neverthele&#383;s guillotined, and the whole
of their immen&#383;e property confi&#383;cated.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Retro&#383;pections, like the&#383;e, obliterate many of my
former notions on the &#383;ubject of the Emigrants; and if I yet
condemn emigration, it is only a&#383; a general mea&#383;ure,
impolitic, and inadequate to the purpo&#383;es for which it was
undertaken. But errors of judgment, in circum&#383;tances &#383;o
unprecedented, cannot be cen&#383;ured con&#383;i&#383;tently with
candour, through we may venture to mark them as a
di&#383;couragement to imitation; for if any nation &#383;hould yet
be menaced by the revolutionary &#383;courge, let it beware of
&#383;eeking external redre&#383;s by a temporary abandonment of
its intere&#383;t&#383; to the madne&#383;s of
&#383;y&#383;temi&#383;ts, or the rapine of needy adventurers. We
mu&#383;t, we ought to, lament the fate of the many gallant men who
have fallen, and the calamities of tho&#383;e who &#383;urvive; but
what in them ha&#383; been a mi&#383;taken policy, will become
guilt in tho&#383;e who, on a &#383;imilar occa&#383;ion,
&#383;hall not be warned by their example. I am concerned when I
hear the&#383;e unhappy fugitives are any where objects of
&#383;u&#383;picion or per&#383;ecution, as it is not likely that
tho&#383;e who really emigrated from principle can merit &#383;uch
treatment: and I doubt not, that mo&#383;t of the in&#383;tances of
treachery or mi&#383;conduct a&#383;cribed to the Emigrants
originated in republican emi&#383;&#383;aries, who have
a&#383;&#383;umed that character for the double purpo&#383;e of
di&#383;crediting it, and of exerci&#383;ing their trade as
&#383;pies.</p>
<p>The common people here, who were retained by Le Bon for
&#383;everal months to attend and applaud his executions, are
&#383;till di&#383;&#383;olute and ferocious, and openly regret the
lo&#383;s of their pay, and the di&#383;u&#383;e of the
guillotine.</p>
<p>&mdash;I came to Arras in mourning, which I have worn &#383;ince
the receipt of your fir&#383;t letter, but was informed by the lady
with whom my friend&#383; lodge, that I mu&#383;t not attempt to
walk the &#383;treets in black, for that it was cu&#383;tomary to
in&#383;ult tho&#383;e who did &#383;o, on a &#383;uppo&#383;ition
that they were related to &#383;ome per&#383;ons who had been
executed; I therefore borrowed a white undre&#383;s, and &#383;tole
out by night to vi&#383;it my unfortunate acquaintance, as I found
it was al&#383;o dangerous to be &#383;een entering
hou&#383;e&#383; known to contain the remains of tho&#383;e
families which had been di&#383;membered by Le Bon's cruelties.</p>
<p>We return to Amiens to-morrow, though you mu&#383;t not imagine
&#383;o formidable a per&#383;on as my&#383;elf is permitted to
wander about the republic without due precaution; and I had much
difficulty in being allowed to come, even attended by a guard, who
has put me to a con&#383;iderable expence; but the man is civil,
and as he has bu&#383;ine&#383;s of his own to tran&#383;act in the
town, he is no embarra&#383;&#383;ment to me.</p>

<h2>Amiens, Nov. 26, 1794.</h2>
<p>The Con&#383;tituent A&#383;&#383;embly, the Legi&#383;lative
A&#383;&#383;embly, and the National Convention, all &#383;eem to
have acted from a per&#383;ua&#383;ion, that their &#383;ole duty
as revolutioni&#383;ts was compri&#383;ed in the de&#383;truction
of whatever exi&#383;ted under the monarchy. If an in&#383;titution
were di&#383;covered to have the &#383;lighte&#383;t defect in
principle, or to have degenerated a little in practice, their
fir&#383;t &#383;tep was to aboli&#383;h it entirely, and leave the
replacing it for the pre&#383;ent to chance, and for the future to
their &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ors. In return for the many new words
which they have introduced into the French language, they have
expunged that of reform; and the havock and deva&#383;tation, which
a Mahometan conqueror might have performed as
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;fully, are as yet the only effects of
philo&#383;ophy and republicani&#383;m.</p>
<p>This &#383;y&#383;tem of ignorance and violence &#383;eems to
have per&#383;ecuted with peculiar ho&#383;tility all the ancient
e&#383;tabli&#383;hments for education; and the &#383;ame plan of
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ing daily what they have neither
lei&#383;ure nor abilities to &#383;upply, which I remarked to you
two years ago, has directed the Convention ever &#383;ince. It is
true, the interval has produced much di&#383;&#383;ertation, and
engendered many projects; but tho&#383;e who were &#383;o unanimous
in rejecting, were extremely di&#383;cordant in adopting, and their
own di&#383;putes and indeci&#383;ion might have convinced them of
their pre&#383;umption in condemning what they now found it &#383;o
difficult to excel. Some decided in favour of public &#383;chools,
after the example of Sparta&mdash; this was objected to by others,
becau&#383;e, &#383;aid they, if you have public &#383;chools you
mu&#383;t have edifices, and governors, and profe&#383;&#383;ors,
who will, to a certainty, be ari&#383;tocrats, or become &#383;o;
and, in &#383;hort, this will only be a revival of the colleges of
the old government&mdash;A third party propo&#383;ed private
&#383;eminaries, or that people might be at liberty to educate
their children in the way they thought be&#383;t; but this, it
wa&#383; declared, would have a &#383;till greater tendency to
ari&#383;tocracy; for the rich, being better able to pay than the
poor, would engro&#383;s all the learning to them&#383;elves. The
Jacobins were of opinion, that there &#383;hould be no
&#383;chools, either public or private, but that the children
&#383;hould merely be taken to hear the debates of the Clubs, where
they would acquire all the knowledge nece&#383;&#383;ary for
republicans; and a few &#383;pirits of a yet &#383;ublimer
ca&#383;t were adver&#383;e both to &#383;chools or clubs, and
recommended, that the ri&#383;ing generation &#383;hould
"&#383;tudy the great book of Nature alone." It is, however, at
length concluded, that there &#383;hall be a certain number of
public e&#383;tabli&#383;hments, and that people &#383;hall even be
allowed to have their children in&#383;tructed at home, under the
in&#383;pection of the con&#383;tituted authorities, who are to
prevent the in&#383;tillation of ari&#383;tocratic principles.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* We may judge of the competency of many of the&#383;e
people to be official cen&#383;ors of education by the following
&#383;pecimens from a report of Gregoire's. Since the rage for
de&#383;truction has a little &#383;ub&#383;ided, circular letters
have been &#383;ent to the admini&#383;trators of the departments,
di&#383;tricts, &amp;c. enquiring what antiquities, or other
objects of curio&#383;ity, remain in their
neighbourhood.&mdash;"From one, (&#383;ays Gregoire,) we are
informed, that they are po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed of nothing in
this way except four va&#383;es, which, as they have been told, are
of porphyry. From a &#383;econd we learn, that, not having either
forge or manufactory in the neighbourhood, no monument of the arts
is to be found there: and a third announces, that the completion of
it&#383; library cataloges has been retarded, becau&#383;e the
per&#383;on employed at them ne fait pas la
diplomatique!"&mdash;("does not under&#383;tand the &#383;cience of
diplomacy.")</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The difficulty as to the mode in which children were to be
taught being got over, another remained, not le&#383;s liable to
di&#383;pute&mdash;which was, the choice of what they were to
learn. Almo&#383;t every member had a favourite
article&mdash;-mu&#383;ic, phy&#383;ic, prophylactics, geography,
geometry, a&#383;tronomy, arithmetic, natural hi&#383;tory, and
botany, were all pronounced to be requi&#383;ites in an
eleemo&#383;ynary &#383;y&#383;tem of education, &#383;pecified to
be chiefly intended for the country people; but as this debate
regarded only the primary &#383;chools for children in their
earlie&#383;t years, and as one man for a &#383;tipend of twelve
hundred livres a year, was to do it all, a compromi&#383;e became
nece&#383;&#383;ary, and it has been agreed for the pre&#383;ent,
that infants of &#383;ix years &#383;hall be taught only reading,
writing, gymna&#383;tics, geometry, geography, natural
philo&#383;ophy, and hi&#383;tory of all free nations, and that of
all the tyrants, the rights of man, and the patriotic &#383;ongs.
&mdash;Yet, after the&#383;e years of con&#383;ideration, and days
of debate, the A&#383;&#383;embly has done no more than a
pari&#383;h-clerk, or an old woman with a primer, and "a twig
whilom of &#383;mall regard to &#383;ee," would do better without
its interference.</p>
<p>The &#383;tudents of a more advanced age are &#383;till to be
di&#383;po&#383;ed of, and the ta&#383;k of devi&#383;ing an
in&#383;titution will not be ea&#383;y; becau&#383;e, perhaps a
Collot d'Herbois or a Duhem is not &#383;ati&#383;fied with the
&#383;y&#383;tem which perfectioned the genius of Monte&#383;quieu
or De&#383;cartes. Change, not improvement, is the
object&mdash;whatever bears a re&#383;emblance to the pa&#383;t
mu&#383;t be pro&#383;cribed; and while other people &#383;tudy to
&#383;implify modes of in&#383;truction, the French
legi&#383;lature is intent on rendering them a&#383; difficult and
complex as po&#383;&#383;ible; and at the moment they decree that
the whole country &#383;hall become learned, they make it an
unfathomable &#383;cience to teach urchins of half a dozen years
old their letters.</p>
<p>Foreigners, indeed, who judge only from the public prints, may
&#383;uppo&#383;e the French far advanced towards becoming the
mo&#383;t erudite nation in Europe: unfortunately, all the&#383;e
&#383;chools, primary, and &#383;econdary, and centrical, and
divergent, and normal,* exi&#383;t as yet but in the repertories of
the Convention, and perhaps may not add "a local habitation" to
their names, till the pre&#383;ent race** &#383;hall be unfit to
reap the benefit of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>* <i>Les Ecoles Normale&#383;</i> were &#383;chools
where ma&#383;ters were to be in&#383;tructed in the art of
teaching. Certain deputies objected to them, as being of feudal
in&#383;titution, &#383;uppo&#383;ing that Normale had &#383;ome
reference to Normandy. ** This was a mi&#383;take, for the French
&#383;eem to have adopted the maxim, "that man is never too old to
learn;" and, accordingly, at the opening of the Normal
&#383;chools, the celebrated Bougainville, now eighty years of age,
became a pupil. This Normal project was, however, &#383;oon
relinqui&#383;hed&mdash;for by that fatality which has hitherto
attended all the republican in&#383;titutions, it was found to have
become a mere nur&#383;ery for ari&#383;tocrats.</blockquote>

<p>But this revolutionary barbari&#383;m, not content with

per&#383;ecuted with &#383;en&#383;ele&#383;s de&#383;poti&#383;m

defaced, &#383;tatue&#383; mutilated, and libraries burnt,
becau&#383;e they reminded the people of their Kings or their
religion; while arti&#383;ts, and men of &#383;cience or
literature, were wa&#383;ting their valuable hours in pri&#383;on,
or expiring on the &#383;caffold.&mdash;The moral and gentle
Florian died of vexation. A life of ab&#383;traction and utility
could not &#383;ave the celebrated chymi&#383;t, Lavoi&#383;ier,
from the Guillotine. La Harpe langui&#383;hed in confinement,
probably, that he might not eclip&#383;e Chenier, who writes
tragedies him&#383;elf; and every author that refu&#383;ed to
degrade his talents by the adulation of tyranny has been
pro&#383;cribed and per&#383;ecuted. Pali&#383;&#383;ot,* at
&#383;ixty years old, wa&#383; de&#383;tined to expiate in a
pri&#383;on a &#383;atire upon Rou&#383;&#383;eau, written when he
was only twenty, and e&#383;caped, not by the interpo&#383;ition of
ju&#383;tice, but by the efficacity of a bon mot.</p>
<blockquote>

Philo&#383;ophers," a comedy, written thirty years ago, to ridicule
Rou&#383;&#383;eau. He wrote to the municipality, acknowledged his

if Rou&#383;&#383;eau were a god, you ought not to &#383;acrifice
human victims to him.&mdash;The expre&#383;&#383;ion, which in

Carrier's murders on the Loire under the appellation of "baptemes

eloquent pedantry of Gregoire, exhibit&#383; traces of the&#383;e
modern Huns, which, though now exclu&#383;ively attributed to the
agents of Robe&#383;pierre and Mr. Pitt,* it is very certain were
authorized by the decrees of the Convention, and executed under the

Mou&#383;&#383;eaux, the &#383;eals were put on the

remains of &#383;culpture were condemned for a cre&#383;t, a fleur
de lys, or a coronet attached to them; and the deities of the
Heathen mythology were made war upon by the ignorance of the
republican executioners, who could not di&#383;tingui&#383;h them

an amateur, who in&#383;i&#383;ted, that &#383;tags of bronze were
not included in the decree.&mdash;By a decree of the Convention,

the law made no di&#383;tinction, it could not be expected that
municipalities, &amp;c. often ignorant or timid, &#383;hould either
venture or de&#383;ire to &#383;pare what in the eyes of the

Charles the Ninth; and if it had been that of Charles the Ninth, it

features of Pliny or Commodus; and Hi&#383;tory and Science will
appreciate Linnaeus and Charles the Ninth, without regarding

&#383;cattered in fragments by republican ignorance.&mdash;Long
after the death of Robe&#383;pierre, the people of Amiens humbly
petitioned the Convention, that their cathedral, perhaps the
mo&#383;t beautiful Gothic edifice in Europe, might be
pre&#383;erved; and to avoid giving offence by the mention of
churches or cathedrals, they called it a Ba&#383;ilique.&mdash;But
it is unnece&#383;&#383;ary to adduce any farther proof, that the
&#383;pirit of what is now called Vandali&#383;m originated in the
Convention. Every one in France mu&#383;t recollect, that, when

<h2>Amiens, Nov. 29, 1794.</h2>
<p>The &#383;elfi&#383;h policy of the Convention in affecting to
re&#383;pect and pre&#383;erve the Jacobin &#383;ocieties, while it
deprived them of all power, and help up the individuals who
compo&#383;ed them to abhorrence, could neither &#383;ati&#383;fy
nor deceive men ver&#383;ed in revolutionary expedients, and more
accu&#383;tomed to dictate laws than to &#383;ubmit to them.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The Jacobins were at this time headed by Billaud
Varenne, Collot, Thuriot, &amp;c.&mdash;veterans, who were not
likely to be deceived by temporizing.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Supported by all the force of government, and intrin&#383;ically
formidable by their union, the Clubs had long exi&#383;ted in
defiance of public reprobation, and for &#383;ome time they had
braved not only the people, but the government it&#383;elf. The
in&#383;tant they were di&#383;abled from corre&#383;ponding and
communicating in that privileged &#383;ort of way which rendered
them &#383;o con&#383;picuous, they felt their weakne&#383;s; and
their de&#383;ultory and unconnected efforts to regain their
influence only &#383;erved to complete it&#383; annihilation. While
they pretended obedience to the regulations to which the Convention
had &#383;ubjected them, they intrigued to promote a revolt, and
were &#383;trenuou&#383;ly exerting them&#383;elves to gain
partizans among the idle and di&#383;&#383;olute, who, having
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ted for months as members of revolutionary
committees, and in other revolutionary offices, were naturally
aver&#383;e from a more moderate government. The numbers of
the&#383;e were far from incon&#383;iderable: and, when it is
recollected that thi&#383; de&#383;cription of people only had been
allowed to retain their arms, while all who had any thing to defend
were deprived of them, we cannot wonder if the Jacobins entertained
hopes of &#383;ucce&#383;s.</p>
<p>The Convention, aware of the&#383;e attempts, now employed
again&#383;t its ancient accomplices the &#383;ame arts that had
proved &#383;o fatal to all tho&#383;e whom it had con&#383;idered
as its enemies. A corre&#383;pondence was "opportunely" intercepted
between the Jacobins and the Emigrants in Switzerland, while
emi&#383;&#383;aries in&#383;inuated them&#383;elves into the
Clubs, for the purpo&#383;e of exciting de&#383;perate motions; or,
di&#383;per&#383;ed in public places, contrived, by
a&#383;&#383;uming the Jacobin co&#383;tume, to throw on the
faction the odium of tho&#383;e &#383;editious exclamations which
they were employed to vociferate.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the de&#383;igns of the Jacobins were
nearly &#383;uch as have been imputed to them. They had, however,
become more politic than to act thus openly, without being prepared
to repel their enemies, or to &#383;upport their friends; and there
is every appearance that the Swi&#383;&#383; plots, and the
in&#383;urrections of the <i>Palais Egalite,</i> were the devices
of the government, to give a pretext for &#383;hutting up the Club
altogether, and to avert the real dangers with which it was
menaced, by &#383;preading an alarm of fictitious ones. A few idle
people a&#383;&#383;embled (probably on purpo&#383;e) about the
<i>Palais Egalite,</i> and the place where the Jacobins held their
meetings, and the exclamation of "Down with the Convention!"
&#383;erved as the &#383;ignal for ho&#383;tilities. The
ari&#383;tocrats joined the partizans of the Convention, the
Jacobins were attacked in their hall, and an affray en&#383;ued, in
which &#383;everal per&#383;ons on each &#383;ide were wounded.
Both partie&#383; accu&#383;ed each other of being the
aggre&#383;&#383;or, and a report of the bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383;
was made to the A&#383;&#383;embly; but the A&#383;&#383;embly had
already decided&mdash;and, on the ninth of November, while the
Jacobins were endeavouring to rai&#383;e the &#383;torm by a
recapitulation of the rights of man, a decree was pa&#383;&#383;ed,
prohibiting their debates, and ordering the national &#383;eal to
be put on their doors and papers. The &#383;ociety were not in
force to make re&#383;i&#383;tance, and the decree was carried into
execution as quietly a&#383; though it had been levelled
again&#383;t the hotel of &#383;ome devoted ari&#383;tocrat.</p>
<p>When the news of this event reached the departments, it
occa&#383;ioned an univer&#383;al rejoicing&mdash;not &#383;uch a
rejoicing as is ordered for the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;e&#383; of
the French arms, (which always &#383;eems to be a matter of great
indifference,) but a chearfulne&#383;s of heart and of countenance;
and many per&#383;ons whom I do not remember to have ever &#383;een
in the lea&#383;t degree moved by political events, appeared
&#383;incerely delighted at thi&#383;&mdash;</p>

<p>The armies might proceed to Vienna, pillage the E&#383;curial,

plea&#383;ure would be excited equal to that manife&#383;ted at the
downfall of the Jacobins of Paris.</p>
<p>Since this di&#383;grace of the parent &#383;ociety, the Clubs
in the department&#383; have, for the mo&#383;t part,
di&#383;&#383;olved them&#383;elves, or dwindled into peaceable
a&#383;&#383;emblies to hear the news read, and applaud the
convention.&mdash;The few Jacobin emblems which were yet remaining
have totally di&#383;appeared, and no ve&#383;tige of
Jacobini&#383;m is left, but the graves of its victims, and the
de&#383;olation of the country.</p>
<p>The profligate, the turbulent, the idle, and needy, of various
countrie&#383; in Europe, have been tempted by the
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es of the French Jacobins to endeavour to
e&#383;tabli&#383;h &#383;imilar in&#383;titutions; but the
&#383;ame &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;es have operated as a warning to
people of a different de&#383;cription, and the fall of the&#383;e
&#383;ocieties has drawn two confe&#383;&#383;ions from their
original partizans, which ought never to be forgotten&mdash;namely,
that they were formed for the purpo&#383;e of &#383;ubverting the
monarchy, and that their exi&#383;tence is incompatible with
regular government of any kind.&mdash;"While the monarchy
&#383;till exi&#383;ted, (&#383;ays the mo&#383;t philo&#383;ophic
Lequinio, with who&#383;e &#383;cheme of reforming La Vendee you
are already acquainted,) it wa&#383; politic and
nece&#383;&#383;ary to encourage popular &#383;ocieties, as the
mo&#383;t efficacious means of operating its de&#383;truction; but
now we have effected a revolution, and have only to
con&#383;olidate it by mild and philo&#383;ophic laws, the&#383;e
&#383;ocieties are dangerous, becau&#383;e they can produce only
confu&#383;ion and di&#383;order."&mdash;This is al&#383;o the
language of Bri&#383;&#383;ot, who admires the Jacobins from their
origin till the end of 1792, but after that period he admits they
were only the in&#383;truments of faction, and de&#383;tructive of
all property and order.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The period of the Jacobin annals &#383;o much admired
by Bri&#383;&#383;ot, compri&#383;es the dethronement of the King,
the ma&#383;&#383;acres of the pri&#383;ons, the bani&#383;hment of
the prie&#383;ts, &amp;c. That which he reprobates begins
preci&#383;ely at the period when the Jacobins di&#383;puted the
claims of him&#383;elf and his party to the exclu&#383;ive
direction of the government.&mdash;See Bri&#383;&#383;ot's
Addre&#383;s to his Con&#383;tituents.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;We learn therefore, not from the abu&#383;es alone, but
from the prai&#383;e&#383; be&#383;towed on the Jacobins, how much
&#383;uch combinations are to be dreaded. Their merit, it appears,
con&#383;i&#383;ted in the &#383;ubver&#383;ion of the monarchical
government, and their crime in cea&#383;ing to be u&#383;eful as
agents of tyranny, the moment they cea&#383;ed to be
principals.</p>
<p>I am &#383;till &#383;ceptical as to the conver&#383;ion of the
A&#383;&#383;embly, and little di&#383;po&#383;ed to expect good
from it; yet whatever it may attempt in future, or however its real
principles may take an a&#383;cendant, this fortunate concurrence
of per&#383;onal intere&#383;ts, coalition of ari&#383;tocrats and
democrats, and political rivalry, have likewi&#383;e &#383;ecured
France from a return of that exce&#383;s of de&#383;poti&#383;m
which could have been exerci&#383;ed only by &#383;uch means. It is
true, the &#383;pirit of the nation is &#383;o much
depre&#383;&#383;ed, that an effort to revive the&#383;e Clubs
might meet no re&#383;i&#383;tance; but the ridicule and opprobrium
to which they have latterly been &#383;ubject, and finally the
manner of their being &#383;acrificed by that very Convention, of
which they were the &#383;ole creators and &#383;upport, will, I
think, cool the zeal, and dimini&#383;h the numbers of their
partizans too much for them ever again to become formidable.</p>
<p>The conduct of Carrier has been examined according to the new
forms, and he is now on his trial&mdash;though not till the delays
of the Convention had given ri&#383;e to a general
&#383;u&#383;picion that they intended either to exonerate or
afford him an opportunity of e&#383;caping; and the people were at
la&#383;t &#383;o highly exa&#383;perated, that &#383;ix
thou&#383;and troops were added to the military force of Paris, and
an in&#383;urrection was &#383;eriou&#383;ly apprehended. Thi&#383;
&#383;timulated the diligence, or relaxed the indulgence, of the
commi&#383;&#383;ion appointed to make the report on Carrier's
conduct; and it being decided that there was room for
accu&#383;ation, the A&#383;&#383;embly confirmed the
deci&#383;ion, and he was ordered into cu&#383;tody, to be tried
along with the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes which had been the
in&#383;trument of his crimes.</p>
<p>It is a circum&#383;tance worth noting, that mo&#383;t of the
Deputies who explained the motives on which they thought Carrier
guilty, were &#383;ilent on the &#383;ubject of his drowning,
&#383;hooting, and guillotining &#383;o many thou&#383;ands of
innocent people, and only declared him guilty, as having been
wanting in re&#383;pect towards Trehouard, one of his colleagues,
and of injuring the republican cau&#383;e by his atrocities.</p>
<p>The fate of this mon&#383;ter exhibits a practical
expo&#383;ition of the enormou&#383; ab&#383;urdity of &#383;uch a
government. He is him&#383;elf tried for the exerci&#383;e of a
power declared to be unbounded when entru&#383;ted to him. The men
tried with him as his accomplices were obliged by the laws to obey
him; and the acts of which they are all accu&#383;ed were known,
applauded, and held out for imitation, by the Convention, who now
declare tho&#383;e very acts to be criminal!&mdash;There is
certainly no way of reconciling ju&#383;tice but by puni&#383;hing
both chiefs and &#383;ubordinates, and the hour for this will yet
come.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h2>Amiens. [No date given.]</h2>
<p>I do not yet venture to corre&#383;pond with my Paris friends by
the po&#383;t, but whenever the opportunity of private conveyance
occurs, I receive long and circum&#383;tantial letters, as well as
packets, of all the publications mo&#383;t read, and the theatrical
pieces mo&#383;t applauded. I have lately drudged through great
numbers of the&#383;e la&#383;t, and be&#383;towed on them an
attention they did not in them&#383;elves de&#383;erve,
becau&#383;e I con&#383;idered it as one mean&#383; of judging both
of the &#383;pirit of the government and the morals of the
people.</p>
<p>The dramas produced at the beginning of the revolution were in
general calculated to corrupt the national ta&#383;te and morals,
and many of them were written with &#383;kill enough to an&#383;wer
the purpo&#383;e for which they were intended; but tho&#383;e that
have appeared during the la&#383;t two years, are &#383;o
&#383;tupid and &#383;o depraved, that the circum&#383;tance of
their being tolerated even for a moment implies an extinction both
of ta&#383;te and of morals.*</p>

<p>The principal cau&#383;e of this is the de&#383;poti&#383;m of
the government in making the &#383;tage a mere political engine,

<p>&mdash;Hence a croud of &#383;cribblers, without &#383;hame or
talents, have become the exclu&#383;ive directors of public
amu&#383;ements, and, as far as the noi&#383;e of a theatre
con&#383;titutes &#383;ucce&#383;s, are perhaps more
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful than ever wa&#383; Racine or Moliere.
Immorality and dulne&#383;s have an infallible re&#383;ource
again&#383;t public di&#383;approbation in the abu&#383;e of
monarchy and religion, or a niche for Mr. Pitt; and an indignant or
impatient audience, lo&#383;ing their other feelings in their
fears, are glad to purcha&#383;e the reputation of patrioti&#383;m
by applauding tra&#383;h they find it difficult to endure. The
theatres &#383;warm with &#383;pies, and to cen&#383;ure a
revolutionary piece, however dete&#383;table even as a
compo&#383;ition, is dangerous, and few have courage to be the
critics of an author who is patronized by the &#383;uperintendants
of the guillotine, or who may retaliate a comment on his poetry by
the &#383;ignificant pro&#383;e of a mandat d'arret.</p>
<p>Men of literature, therefore, have wi&#383;ely preferred the
con&#383;ervation of their freedom to the vindication of their
ta&#383;te, and have deemed it better to applaud at the Theatre de
la Republique, than lodge at St. Lazare or
Duple&#383;&#383;is.&mdash;Thus political &#383;lavery has
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted moral depravation: the writer who is the
advocate of de&#383;poti&#383;m, may be dull and licentious by
privilege, and is alone exempt from the laws of
Parna&#383;&#383;u&#383; and of decency.&mdash;One Sylvan Marechal,
author of a work he call&#383; philo&#383;ophie, has written a
&#383;ort of farce, which has been performed very generally, where
all the Kings in Europe are brought together as &#383;o many
mon&#383;ters; and when the King of France is enquired after as not
being among them, a Frenchman an&#383;wers,&mdash;"Oh, he is not
here&mdash;we have guillotined him&mdash;we have cut off his head
according to law."&mdash;In one piece, the hero is a felon
e&#383;caped from the galleys, and is repre&#383;ented as a patriot
of the mo&#383;t &#383;ublime principles; in another, he is the
virtuous conductor of a gang of banditti; and the principal
character in a third, is a ploughman turned dei&#383;t and
politician.</p>
<p>Yet, while the&#383;e malevolent and mercenary &#383;cribblers
are ran&#383;acking pa&#383;t ages for the crimes of Kings or the
abu&#383;es of religion, and imputing to both many that never
exi&#383;ted, they forget that neither their books nor their
imagination are able to furni&#383;h &#383;cenes of guilt and
mi&#383;ery equal to tho&#383;e which have been pre&#383;ented
daily by republicans and philo&#383;ophers. What horror can their
mock-tragedies excite in tho&#383;e who have contemplated the Place
de la Revolution? or who can &#383;mile at a farce in ridicule of
monarchy, that beholds the Convention, and knows the characters of
the men who compo&#383;e it?&mdash;But in mo&#383;t of the&#383;e
wretched productions the ab&#383;urdity is luckily not le&#383;s
con&#383;picuous than the immoral intention: their Princes, their
Prie&#383;ts, their Nobles, are all tyrannical, vicious, and
mi&#383;erable; yet the common people, living under the&#383;e
&#383;ame vicious tyrants, are de&#383;cribed as models of virtue,
ho&#383;pitality, and happine&#383;s. If, then, the auditors of
&#383;uch edifying dramas were in the habit of rea&#383;oning, they
might very ju&#383;tly conclude, that the ignorance which
republicani&#383;m is to bani&#383;h is de&#383;irable, and that
the diffu&#383;ion of riches with which they have been flattered,
will only increa&#383;e their vices, and &#383;ubtract from their
felicity.</p>
<p>There are, however, &#383;ome patriotic &#383;pirits, who, not
in&#383;en&#383;ible to thi&#383; degeneracy of the French theatre,
and lamenting the evil, have lately exerci&#383;ed much ingenuity
in developing the cau&#383;e. They have at length di&#383;covered,
that all the republican tragedies, flat farces, and heavy comedies,
are attributable to Mr. Pitt, who has thought proper to corrupt the
authors, with a view to deprave the public ta&#383;te. There is,
certainly, no combating this charge; for as, according to the
a&#383;&#383;ertion&#383; of the Convention, Mr. Pitt has
&#383;ucceeded in bribing nearly every other de&#383;cription of
men in the republic, we may &#383;uppo&#383;e the con&#383;ciences
of &#383;uch &#383;cribblers not le&#383;s flexible. Mr. Pitt,
indeed, &#383;tands accu&#383;ed, &#383;ometimes in conjunction
with the Prince of Cobourg, and &#383;ometimes on hi&#383; own
account, of &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively corrupting the officers of
the fleet and army, all the bankers and all the farmers, the
prie&#383;ts who &#383;ay ma&#383;&#383;es, and the people who
attend them, the chiefs of the ari&#383;tocrats, and the leaders of
the Jacobins. The bakers who refu&#383;e to bake when they have no
flour, and the populace who murmur when they have no bread,
be&#383;ides the merchants and &#383;hopkeepers who prefer coin to
a&#383;&#383;ignats, are notoriou&#383;ly pen&#383;ioned by him:
and even a part of the Repre&#383;entatives, and all the frail
beauties, are &#383;aid to be enli&#383;ted in his
&#383;ervice.&mdash;The&#383;e multifarious charges will be found
on the journals of the A&#383;&#383;embly, and we mu&#383;t of
cour&#383;e infer, that Mr. Pitt is the able&#383;t
&#383;tate&#383;man, or the French the mo&#383;t corrupt nation,
exi&#383;ting.</p>
<p>But it is not only Barrere and his colleagues who
&#383;uppo&#383;e the whole country bribeable&mdash;the notion is
common to the French in general; and vanity adding to the
omnipotence of gold, whenever they &#383;peak of a battle
lo&#383;t, or a town taken, they conclude it impo&#383;&#383;ible
to have occurred but through the venal treachery of their
officers.&mdash;The Engli&#383;h, I have ob&#383;erved, always
judge differently, and would not think the national honour
&#383;u&#383;tained by a &#383;uppo&#383;ition that their
commanders were vulnerable only in the hand. If a general or an
admiral happen to be unfortunate, it would be with the utmo&#383;t
reluctance that we &#383;hould think of attributing his
mi&#383;chance to a cau&#383;e &#383;o degrading; yet whoever has
been u&#383;ed to French &#383;ociety will acknowledge, that the
fir&#383;t &#383;ugge&#383;tion on &#383;uch events is <i>"nos
officiers ont ete gagnes,"</i> [Our officers were bought.] or
<i>"&#383;ans la trahi&#383;on ce ne &#383;eroit pas arrive."</i>
[This could not have happened without treachery.]&mdash;Pope's
hyperbole of</p>
<center>"Ju&#383;t half the land would buy, and half be
&#383;old,"</center>
<p>is more than applicable here; for if we may credit the French
them&#383;elves, the buyers are by no means &#383;o well
proportioned to the &#383;ellers.</p>
<p>As I have no new political intelligence to comment upon, I
&#383;hall fini&#383;h my letter with a dome&#383;tic adventure of
the morning.&mdash;Our hou&#383;e wa&#383; ye&#383;terday
a&#383;&#383;igned as the quarters of &#383;ome officers, who, with
part of a regiment, were pa&#383;&#383;ing this way to join the
Northern army. As they &#383;pent the evening out, we &#383;aw
nothing of them, but finding one was a Colonel, and the other a
Captain, though we knew what republican colonels and captains might
be, we thought it civil, or rather nece&#383;&#383;ary, to
&#383;end them an invitation to breakfa&#383;t. We therefore
ordered &#383;ome milk coffee early, (for Frenchmen &#383;eldom
take tea,) and were all a&#383;&#383;embled before the u&#383;ual
time to receive our military gue&#383;ts. As they did not, however,
appear, we were ringing to enquire for them, when Mr. D____ entered
from hi&#383; morning walk, and de&#383;ired us to be at ea&#383;e
on their account, for that in pa&#383;&#383;ing the kitchen, he had
perceived the Captain fraternizing over &#383;ome onions, bread,
and beer, with our man; while the Colonel was in clo&#383;e
conference with the cook, and watching a pan of &#383;oup, which
was warming for his breakfa&#383;t. We have learned &#383;ince,
that the&#383;e heroes were very willing to accept of any thing the
&#383;ervants offered them, but could not be prevailed upon to
approach us; though, you are to under&#383;tand, this wa&#383; not
occa&#383;ioned either by timidity or incivility, but by mere
ignorance. &mdash;Mr. D____ &#383;ays, the Marqui&#383;e and I have
not dive&#383;ted our&#383;elves of ari&#383;tocratic
a&#383;&#383;ociations with our ideas of the military, and that our
de&#383;habilles this morning were unu&#383;ually coqueti&#383;h.
Our projects of conque&#383;t were, however, all fru&#383;trated by
the unlucky intervention of Bernardine's <i>&#383;oupe aux
choux,</i> [Cabbage-&#383;oup.] and Eu&#383;tace's regale of
chee&#383;e and onions.</p>

<h2>Amiens, Dec. 10, 1794.</h2>
<p>Your American friend pa&#383;&#383;ed through here
ye&#383;terday, and delivered me the two parcels. As marks of your
attention, they were very acceptable; but on any other account, I
a&#383;&#383;ure you, I &#383;hould have preferred a pre&#383;ent
of a few pecks of wheat to all your fineries.</p>
<p>I have been u&#383;ed to conclude, when I &#383;aw &#383;uch
&#383;trange and unaccountable ab&#383;urdities given in the French
papers as extracts from the debates in either of your Hou&#383;es
of Parliament, that they were probably fabricated here to
&#383;erve the de&#383;igns of the reigning factions: yet I
perceive, by &#383;ome old papers which came with the mu&#383;lins,
that there are really members &#383;o ill-informed or &#383;o
unprincipled, as to u&#383;e the language attributed to them, and
who a&#383;&#383;ert that the French are attached to their
government, and call France "a land of republicans."</p>
<p>When it is &#383;aid that a people are republicans, we mu&#383;t
&#383;uppo&#383;e they are either partial to republicani&#383;m as
a &#383;y&#383;tem, or that they prefer it in practice. A little
retro&#383;pection, perhaps, will determine both the&#383;e points
better than the eloquence of your orators.</p>
<p>A few men, of philo&#383;ophic or re&#383;tle&#383;s minds,
have, in various ages and countries, endeavoured to enlighten or
di&#383;turb the world by examination&#383; and di&#383;putes on
forms of government; yet the be&#383;t heads and the be&#383;t
hearts have remained divided on the &#383;ubject, and I never heard
that any writer was able to produce more than a partial conviction,
even in the mo&#383;t limited circle. Whence, then, did it happen
in France, where information was avowedly confined, and where
&#383;uch di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ions could not have been general,
that the people became &#383;uddenly in&#383;pired with thi&#383;
political &#383;agacity, which made them in one day the judges and
converts of a &#383;y&#383;tem they could &#383;carcely have known
before, even by name?&mdash;At the depo&#383;ition of the King, the
French, (&#383;peaking at large,) had a&#383; per&#383;picuous a
notion of republics, as they may be &#383;uppo&#383;ed to have of
mathematics, and would have under&#383;tood Euclid's Elements as
well as the Social Contract. Yet an a&#383;&#383;emblage of the
wor&#383;t and mo&#383;t daring men from every faction, elected
amid&#383;t ma&#383;&#383;acres and pro&#383;cription, the moment
they are collected together, declare, on the propo&#383;al of
Collot d'Herbois, a profligate &#383;trolling player, that France
&#383;hall be a republic.&mdash;Admitting that the French were
de&#383;irous of altering their form of government, I believe no
one will venture to &#383;ay &#383;uch an inclination was ever
manife&#383;ted, or that the Convention were elected in a manner to
render them competent to &#383;uch a deci&#383;ion. They were not
the choice of the people, but chiefly emi&#383;&#383;aries
impo&#383;ed on the departments by the Jacobin&#383; and the
municipality of Paris; and let tho&#383;e who are not acquainted
with the means by which the elections were obtained, examine the
compo&#383;ition of the A&#383;&#383;embly it&#383;elf, and then
decide whether any people being free could have &#383;elected
&#383;uch men as Petion, Tallien, Robe&#383;pierre,
Bri&#383;&#383;ot, Carrier, Taillefer, &amp;c. &amp;c. from the
whole nation to be their Repre&#383;entatives.&mdash;There
mu&#383;t, in all large a&#383;&#383;ociations, be a mixture of
good and bad; but when it is incontrovertible that the principal
member&#383; of the Convention are mon&#383;ters, who, we hope, are
not to be paralleled&mdash; that the re&#383;t are inferior rather
in talents than wickedne&#383;s, or coward&#383; and ideots, who
have &#383;upported and applauded crimes they only wanted
opportunity to commit&mdash;it is not po&#383;&#383;ible to
conceive, that any people in the world could make a &#383;imilar
choice. Yet if the French were ab&#383;olutely unbia&#383;&#383;ed,
and of their own free will made this collection, who would, after
&#383;uch an example, be the advocates of general &#383;uffrage and
popular repre&#383;entation?&mdash;But, I repeat, the people were
not free. They were not, indeed, influenced by
bribe&#383;&mdash;they were intimidated by the horrors of the
moment; and along with the regulations for the new elections, were
every where circulated details of the
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inations of Augu&#383;t and
September.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The influence of the municipality of Paris on the new
elections i&#383; well known. The following letter will &#383;how
what in&#383;truments were employed, and the de&#383;cription of
Repre&#383;entatives likely to be cho&#383;en under &#383;uch
au&#383;pices. "Circular letter, written by the Committee of
In&#383;pection of the municipality of Paris to all the departments
of the republic, dated the third of September, the &#383;econd day

ferocious con&#383;pirators detained in the pri&#383;ons have been

to them indi&#383;pen&#383;able, to re&#383;train by terror
tho&#383;e legions of traitors whom they mu&#383;t have left behind
when they departed for the army. There is no doubt but the whole
nation, after &#383;uch multiplied trea&#383;ons, will ha&#383;ten

the Commune of Paris and the Mini&#383;ter of Ju&#383;tice. Who,
after this mandate, would venture to oppo&#383;e a member
recommended by the Commune of Paris?</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;The French, then, neither cho&#383;e the republican form
of government, nor the men who adopted it; and are, therefore, not
republicans on principle.&mdash;Let us now con&#383;ider whether,
not being republicans on principle, experience may have rendered
them &#383;uch.</p>
<p>The fir&#383;t effects of the new &#383;y&#383;tem were an
univer&#383;al con&#383;ternation, the di&#383;appearance of all
the &#383;pecie, an extravagant ri&#383;e in the price of
provi&#383;ions, and many indications of &#383;carcity. The
&#383;candalous quarrels of the legi&#383;lature &#383;hocked the
national vanity, by making France the ridicule of all Europe, until
ridicule was &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed by dete&#383;tation at the
&#383;ub&#383;equent murder of the King. This was followed by the
efforts of one faction to &#383;trengthen it&#383;elf again&#383;t
another, by means of a general war&mdash;the leaders of the former
pre&#383;uming, that they alone were capable of conducting it.</p>
<p>To the mi&#383;eries of war were added revolutionary tribunals,
revolutionary armies and committees, forced loans,
requi&#383;itions, maximums, and every &#383;pecies of tyranny and
iniquity man could devi&#383;e or &#383;uffer; or, to u&#383;e the
expre&#383;&#383;ion of Rewbell, [One of the Directory in 1796.]
"France was in mourning and de&#383;olation; all her families
plunged in de&#383;pair; her whole &#383;urface covered with
Ba&#383;tilles, and the republican government become &#383;o
odious, that the mo&#383;t wretched &#383;lave, bending beneath the
weight of hi&#383; chains, would have refu&#383;ed to live under
it!"</p>
<p>Such were the means by which France was converted into a land of
republicans, and &#383;uch the government to which your patriots
a&#383;&#383;ert the French people were attached: yet &#383;o
little was this attachment appreciated here, that the mere
in&#383;titutions for watching and &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ing
di&#383;affection amount, by the confe&#383;&#383;ion of Cambon,
the financier, to twenty-four millions &#383;ix hundred and
thirty-one thou&#383;and pounds &#383;terling a year!</p>
<p>To &#383;uppo&#383;e, then, that the French are devoted to a
&#383;y&#383;tem which ha&#383; &#383;erved as a pretext for
&#383;o many crimes, and has been the cau&#383;e of &#383;o many
calamities, is to conclude them a nation of philo&#383;ophers, who
are able to endure, yet incapable of rea&#383;oning; and who
&#383;uffer evils of every kind in defence of a principle with
which they can be little acquainted, and which, in practice, they
have known only by the de&#383;truction it ha&#383;
occa&#383;ioned.</p>
<p>You may, perhaps, have been per&#383;uaded, that the people
&#383;ubmit patiently now, for the &#383;ake of an advantage in
per&#383;pective; but it is not in the di&#383;po&#383;ition of
unenlightened men (and the ma&#383;s of a people mu&#383;t
nece&#383;&#383;arily be &#383;o) to give up the pre&#383;ent for
the future. The individual may &#383;ometimes atchieve this painful
conque&#383;t over him&#383;elf, and &#383;ubmit to evil, on a
calculation of future retribution, but the multitude will ever
prefer the good mo&#383;t immediately attainable, if not under the
influence of that terror which &#383;uper&#383;edes every other
con&#383;ideration. Recollect, then, the coun&#383;el of the
fir&#383;t hi&#383;torian of our age, and "&#383;u&#383;pend your
belief of whatever deviates from the laws of nature and the
character of man;" and when you are told the French are attached to
a government which oppre&#383;&#383;es them, or to principles of
which they are ignorant, &#383;uppo&#383;e their adoption of the
one, and their &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion to the other, are the
re&#383;ult of fear, and that tho&#383;e who make the&#383;e
a&#383;&#383;ertions to the contrary, are either intere&#383;ted or
mi&#383;informed.</p>
<p>Excu&#383;e me if I have devoted a few pages to a &#383;ubject
which with you i&#383; ob&#383;olete. I am indignant at the
peru&#383;al of &#383;uch fal&#383;ehoods; and though I feel for
the humiliation of great talents, I feel &#383;till more for the
di&#383;grace &#383;uch an abu&#383;e of them brings on our
country.</p>
<p>It is not inappo&#383;ite to mention a circum&#383;tance which
happened to a friend of Mr. D____'s, &#383;ome little time
&#383;ince, at Paris. He was pa&#383;&#383;ing through France, in
his way from Italy, at the time of the general arre&#383;t, and
wa&#383; detained there till the other day. As &#383;oon as he was
relea&#383;ed from pri&#383;on, he applied in per&#383;on to a
member of the Convention, to learn when he might hope to return to
England. The Deputy replied, <i>"Ma &#383;oi je n'en &#383;ais
rien</i> [Faith I can't tell you.]&mdash;If your
Me&#383;&#383;ieurs (naming &#383;ome members in the
oppo&#383;ition) had &#383;ucceeded in promoting a revolution, you
would not have been in your cage &#383;o long&mdash;<i>mais pour le
coup il faut attendre."</i> [But now you mu&#383;t have patience.]
It is not probable the members he named could have &#383;uch
de&#383;igns, but Dumont once held the &#383;ame language to me;
and it is mortifying to hear the&#383;e mi&#383;creants
&#383;uppo&#383;e, that factious or ambitious men, becau&#383;e
they chance to po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s talents, can make revolutions
in England as they have done in France.</p>
<p>In the papers which gave ri&#383;e to the&#383;e reflections, I
ob&#383;erve that &#383;ome of your manufacturing towns are
di&#383;contented, and attribute the &#383;tagnation of their
commerce to the war; but it is not unlikely, that the
&#383;tagnation and failures complained of might have taken place,
though the war had not happened.&mdash;When I came here in 1792,
every &#383;hop and warehou&#383;e were over-&#383;tocked with
Engli&#383;h goods. I could purcha&#383;e any article of our
manufacture at nearly the retail price of London; and &#383;ome I
&#383;ent for from Paris, in the beginning of 1793,
notwith&#383;tanding the reports of war, were very little advanced.
Soon after the conclu&#383;ion of the commercial treaty, every
thing Engli&#383;h became fa&#383;hionable; and &#383;o many people
had &#383;peculated in con&#383;equence, that &#383;imilar
&#383;peculations took place in England. But France was glutted
before the war; and all &#383;peculation&#383; entered into on a
pre&#383;umption of a demand equal to that of the fir&#383;t years
of the treaty, mu&#383;t have failed in a certain degree, though
the two countries had remained at peace.&mdash;Even after a two
years ce&#383;&#383;ation of direct intercour&#383;e, Briti&#383;h
manufactures are every where to be procured, which is a
&#383;ufficient proof that either the country was previou&#383;ly
over &#383;upplied, or that they are &#383;till imported through
neutral or indirect channels. Both the&#383;e
&#383;uppo&#383;itions preclude the likelihood that the war has
&#383;o great a &#383;hare in relaxing the activity of your
commerce, as i&#383; pretended.</p>
<p>But whatever may be the effect of the war, there is no
pro&#383;pect of peace, until the efforts of England, or the total
ruin of the French finances,* &#383;hall open the way for it.</p>

expences of France in 1792 were eighteen millions
&#383;terling&mdash;in 1793, near ninety million&#383;&mdash;and,
in the &#383;pring of 1794, twelve and a half millions per
month!&mdash;The church bells, we learn from the &#383;ame

they produced as money. The church plate, which was brought to the
bar of the Convention with &#383;uch eclat, and repre&#383;ented as
an inexhau&#383;tible re&#383;ource, amounted to &#383;carcely a
million &#383;terling: for as the offering was every where
involuntary, and promoted by its agents for the purpo&#383;es of
pillage, part was &#383;ecreted, a &#383;till greater part
&#383;tolen, and, as the conveyance to Paris was a &#383;ort of
job, the expences often exceeded the worth&mdash;a patine, a
cen&#383;or, and a &#383;mall chalice, were &#383;ent to the
Convention, perhaps an hundred leagues, by a couple of Jacobin
Commi&#383;&#383;ioners in a coach and four, with a military
e&#383;cort. Thus, the prejudices of the people were outraged, and

<p>No one is here ignorant of the &#383;ource of Tallien's

<h2>Amiens, Dec. 16, 1794.</h2>
<p>The &#383;eventy-three Deputies who have been &#383;o long
confined are now liberated, and have re&#383;umed their &#383;eats.
Jealou&#383;y and fear for &#383;ome time rendered the Convention
aver&#383;e from the adoption of this mea&#383;ure; but the public
opinion was &#383;o determined in favour of it, that farther
re&#383;i&#383;tance might not have been prudent. The
&#383;ati&#383;faction created by this event i&#383; general,
though the &#383;ame &#383;entiment is the re&#383;ult of various
conclu&#383;ions, which, however, all tend to one object&mdash;the
re-e&#383;tabli&#383;hment of monarchy.</p>
<p>The idea mo&#383;t prevalent is, that the&#383;e deputies, when
arre&#383;ted, were royali&#383;ts.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This opinion prevailed in many places where the
pro&#383;cribed deputies took refuge. "The Normans (&#383;ays
Louvet) deceived by the imputations in the new&#383;papers,
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted us, under the idea that we were
royali&#383;ts: but abandoned us when they found
them&#383;elve&#383; mi&#383;taken." In the &#383;ame manner, on
the appearance of the&#383;e Deputie&#383; in other departments,
armies were collecting very fa&#383;t, but di&#383;per&#383;ed when
they perceived the&#383;e men were actuated only by per&#383;onal
fear or per&#383;onal ambition, and that no one talked of
re&#383;toring the monarchy.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;By &#383;ome it is thought, per&#383;ecution may have
converted them; but the reflecting part of the nation look on the
greater number as adherents of the Girondi&#383;ts, whom the
fortunate violence of Robe&#383;pierre excluded from participating
in many of the pa&#383;t crimes of their colleagues, and who have,
in that alone, a rea&#383;on for not becoming accomplices in
tho&#383;e which may be attempted in future.</p>
<p>It is a&#383;toni&#383;hing to &#383;ee with what facility
people daily take on tru&#383;t things which they have it in their
power to a&#383;certain. The &#383;eventy-three owe a great part of
the intere&#383;t they have excited to a per&#383;ua&#383;ion of
their having voted either for a mild &#383;entence on the King, or
an appeal to the nation: yet this is &#383;o far from being true,
that many of them were unfavourable to him on every que&#383;tion.
But &#383;uppo&#383;ing it to have been otherwi&#383;e, their merit
is in reality little enhanced: they all voted him guilty, without
examining whether he was &#383;o or not; and in affecting mercy
while they refu&#383;ed ju&#383;tice, they only aimed at
conciliating their pre&#383;ent views with their future
&#383;afety.</p>
<p>The whole claim of this party, who are now the Moderates of the
Convention, is reducible to their having oppo&#383;ed the
commi&#383;&#383;ion of crime&#383; which were intended to
&#383;erve their adver&#383;aries, rather than them&#383;elves. To
effect the dethronement of the King, and the de&#383;truction of
tho&#383;e obnoxious to them, they approved of popular
in&#383;urrections; but expected that the people whom they had
rendered proficients in cruelty, &#383;hould become gentle and
obedient when urged to re&#383;i&#383;t their own authority; yet
they now come forth as victims of their patrioti&#383;m, and call
the heads of the faction who are fallen&mdash;martyrs to liberty!
But if they are victims, it is to their folly or wickedne&#383;s in
becoming members of &#383;uch an a&#383;&#383;embly; and if their
chiefs were martyrs, it was to the principles they inculcated.</p>
<p>The trial of the Bri&#383;&#383;otins was ju&#383;tice, compared
with that of the King. If the former were condemned without proof,
their partizans &#383;hould remember, that the revolutionary jury
pretended to be influenced by the &#383;ame moral evidence they had
them&#383;elves urged as the ground on which they condemned the
King; and if the people beheld with applau&#383;e or indifference
the execution of their once-popular idols, they only put in
practice the barbarous le&#383;&#383;ons which tho&#383;e idols had
taught them;&mdash;they were forbidden to lament the fate of their
Sovereign, and they rejoiced in that of Bri&#383;&#383;ot and his
confederates.&mdash;The&#383;e men, then, only found the ju&#383;t
retribution of their own guilt; and though it may be politic to
forget that their &#383;urvivors were al&#383;o their accomplices,
they are not objects of e&#383;teem&mdash;and the contemporary
popularity, which a long &#383;eclu&#383;ion has obtained for them,
will vani&#383;h, if their future conduct &#383;hould be directed
by their original principles.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Louvet's pamphlet had not at this time appeared, and
the &#383;ub&#383;equent events proved, that the intere&#383;t
taken in the&#383;e Deputie&#383; was founded on a
&#383;uppo&#383;ition they had changed their principles; for before
the clo&#383;e of the Convention they were as much objects of
hatred and contempt as their colleagues.</blockquote>

<p>Some of the&#383;e Deputies were the hirelings of the Duke of
Orleans, and mo&#383;t of them are individuals of no better
reputation than the re&#383;t of the A&#383;&#383;embly. Lanjuinais
has the merit of having acted with great courage in defence of
him&#383;elf and his party on the thirty-fir&#383;t of May 1792;
but the following anecdote, recited by Gregoire* in the Convention
a few days ago will &#383;ufficiently explain both his character
and Gregoire's, who are now, however, looked up to as
royali&#383;ts, and as men comparatively hone&#383;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Gregoire is one of the con&#383;titutional Clergy,
and, from the habit of comparing bad with wor&#383;e, is more
e&#383;teemed than many of hi&#383; colleagues; yet, in his report
on the progre&#383;s of Vandali&#383;m, he expre&#383;&#383;es
him&#383;elf with &#383;anguinary indecency&mdash;"They have torn
(&#383;ay&#383; he) the prints which repre&#383;ented the execution
of Charles the fir&#383;t, becau&#383;e there were coats of arms on
them. Ah, would to god we could behold, engraved in the &#383;ame
manner, the heads of all Kings, done from nature! We might then
reconcile our&#383;elves to &#383;eeing a ridiculous
embelli&#383;hment of heraldry accompany them."</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"When I fir&#383;t arrived at Ver&#383;ailles, (&#383;ays
Gregoire,) as member of the Con&#383;tituent A&#383;&#383;embly,

dethrone the King and aboli&#383;h Nobility." Now, thi&#383; was
before the alledged provocations of the King and
Nobility&mdash;before the con&#383;titution was framed&mdash;before
the flight of the royal family to Varenne&#383;&mdash;and before
the war. But almo&#383;t daily confe&#383;&#383;ions of this

the &#383;ad &#383;cience of di&#383;criminating the &#383;hades of
wickedne&#383;s, in which (as I have before noticed) the French
have been rendered &#383;uch adepts, oblige them at pre&#383;ent to
fix their hope&#383;&mdash;not according to the degree of merit,
but by that of guilt. They are reduced to di&#383;tingui&#383;h
between tho&#383;e who &#383;anction murders, and tho&#383;e who
perpetrated them&mdash;between the &#383;acrificer of one

a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inate, and tho&#383;e who only reward the

purpo&#383;e&mdash;implying, that they apprehended the
di&#383;coveries he might make on his trial. While he was
dre&#383;&#383;ing him&#383;elf, (for they took him in bed,) he
added, "<i>Les Scelerat&#383;!</i> (Meaning his more particular
accomplices, who, he was told, had voted again&#383;t him,) they
de&#383;erved that I &#383;hould be as da&#383;tardly as

<p>&mdash;Of thirty who were tried with him as his agents, and

Jury. The Revolutionary Jury was not only in&#383;tituted, but even
appointed by the Convention.&mdash;The following is a literal
tran&#383;lation of &#383;ome of the verdicts given on this
occa&#383;ion: "That O'Sulivan is author and accomplice of
&#383;everal noyade&#383; (drownings) and unheard-of cruelties
towards the victims delivered to the waves. "That Lefevre is proved
to have ordered and cau&#383;ed to be executed a noyade of men,
women, and children, and to have committed variou&#383; arbitrary
acts. "That General Heron is proved to have
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;inated children, and worn publicly in his
hat the ear of a man he had murdered. That he al&#383;o killed two
children who were peaceably watching &#383;heep. "That Bachelier is
author and accomplice of the operations at Nantes, in &#383;igning
arbitrary mandates of arre&#383;t, impo&#383;ing vexatiou&#383;
taxes, and taking for him&#383;elf plate, &amp;c. found at the
hou&#383;es of citizens arre&#383;ted on &#383;u&#383;picion. "That
Joly is guilty, &amp;c. in executing the arbitrary orders of the
Revolutionary Committee, of tying together the victims
de&#383;tined to be drowned or &#383;hot." There are thirty-one
articles conceived nearly in the &#383;ame terms, and which
conclude thu&#383;&mdash;"All convicted as above, but not having
acted with criminal or counter-revolutionary intentions, the
Tribunal acquits and &#383;ets them at liberty." All France was
indignant at tho&#383;e verdicts, and the people of Pari&#383; were
&#383;o enraged, that the Convention ordered the acquitted
culprit&#383; to be arre&#383;ted again, perhaps rather for
protection than puni&#383;hment. They were &#383;ent from Paris,
and I never heard the re&#383;ult; but I have &#383;een the name of
General Heron as being at large.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Convention were certainly de&#383;irous that the atrocities
of the&#383;e men (all zealous republicans) &#383;hould be
forgotten; for, independently of the di&#383;grace which their
trial has brought on the cau&#383;e, the &#383;acrifice of
&#383;uch agents might create a dangerous timidity in future, and
deprive the government of valuable partizans, who would fear to be
the in&#383;truments of crimes for which, after &#383;uch a
precedent, they might become re&#383;pon&#383;ible. But the evil,
which was unavoidable, has been palliated by the
tenderne&#383;&#383; or gratitude of a jury cho&#383;en by the
Convention, who, by &#383;acrificing two only of this ma&#383;s of
mon&#383;ters, and protecting the re&#383;t, hope to
con&#383;ecrate the u&#383;eful principle of indulgence for every
act, whatever it&#383; enormity, which has been the
con&#383;equence of zeal or obedience to the government.</p>
<p>It is among the dreadful &#383;ingularities of the revolution,
that the greate&#383;t crimes which have been committed were all in
&#383;trict ob&#383;ervance of the laws. Hence the Convention are
perpetually embarra&#383;&#383;ed by intere&#383;t or &#383;hame,
when it becomes nece&#383;&#383;ary to puni&#383;h them. We have
only to compare the conduct of Carrier, le Bon, Maignet, &amp;c.
with the decrees under which they acted, to be convinced that their
chief guilt lies in having been capable of obeying: and the
convention, coldly i&#383;&#383;uing forth their re&#383;cripts of
extermination and conflagration, will not, in the opinion of the
morali&#383;t, be favorably di&#383;tingui&#383;hed from tho&#383;e
who carried the&#383;e mandates into execution.</p>

<h2>December 24, 1794.</h2>
<p>I am now at a village a few miles from Amiens, where, upon
giving &#383;ecurity in the u&#383;ual form, we have been permitted
to come for a few day&#383; on a vi&#383;it to &#383;ome relations
of my friend Mad. de ____. On our arrival, we found the lady of the
hou&#383;e in a nankeen pierrot, knitting grey thread
&#383;tockings for her&#383;elf, and the gentleman in a thick
woollen jacket and pantaloons, at work in the fields, and really
labouring as hard as hi&#383; men.&mdash;They hope, by thus taking
up the occupation and a&#383;&#383;uming the appearance of farmers,
to e&#383;cape farther per&#383;ecution; and this policy may be
available to tho&#383;e who have little to lo&#383;e: but property
is now a more dangerous di&#383;tinction than birth, and whoever
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;es it, will alway&#383; be
con&#383;idered as the enemies of the republic, and treated
accordingly.</p>
<p>We have been &#383;o much confined the la&#383;t twelve months,
that we were glad to ride ye&#383;terday in &#383;pite of the cold;
and our ho&#383;ts having procured a&#383;&#383;es for the females
of the party, accompanied us them&#383;elves on foot.&mdash; During
our ramble, we entered into conver&#383;ation with two old men and
a boy, who were at work in an open field near the road. They told
us, they had not &#383;trength to labour, becau&#383;e they had not
their u&#383;ual quantity of bread&mdash;that their good lady,
who&#383;e chateau we &#383;aw at a di&#383;tance, had been
guillotined, or el&#383;e they &#383;hould have wanted for
nothing&mdash;<i>"Et &#383;te pauvre Javotte la n'auroit pas
travaille quant elle e&#383;t qual&#383;iment prete a mourir."</i>
["And our poor Javotte there would not have had to work when
&#383;he is almo&#383;t in her grave."]&mdash;<i>"Mon dieu,"</i>
(&#383;ays one of the old men, who had not yet &#383;poke,) <i>"Je
donnerais bien ma portion de &#383;a terre pour la ravoir notre
bonne dame."</i> ["God knows, I would willingly give up my
&#383;hare of her e&#383;tate to have our good lady among&#383;t us
again."]&mdash;<i>"Ah pour ca oui,"</i> (returned the other,)
<i>"mais j'crois que nous n'aurons ni l'une l'autre, voila &#383;te
maudite nation qui &#383;'empare de tout."</i> ["Ah truly, but I
fancy we &#383;hall have neither one nor the other, for this
cur&#383;ed nation gets hold of every thing."]</p>
<p>While they were going on in this &#383;tyle, a berline and four
cabriolets, with three-coloured flags at the windows, and a whole
troop of national guard, pa&#383;&#383;ed along the road. <i>"Vive
la Republique!"</i>&mdash;"Vive la Nation!" cried our
pea&#383;ants, in an in&#383;tant; and as &#383;oon as the
cavalcade was out of &#383;ight, <i>"Voyez &#383;te gueu&#383;aille
la, quel train, c'e&#383;t vraiment quelque depute de la
Convention&mdash;ces brigands la, ils ne manquent de rien, il&#383;
vivent comme des rois, et nous autres nous &#383;ommes cent
&#383;ois plu&#383; mi&#383;erables que jamais."</i> ["See there
what a figure they make, tho&#383;e beggarly
fellow&#383;&mdash;it's &#383;ome deputy of the convention I take
it. The thieves want for nothing, they live like &#383;o many
kings, and we are all a hundred times wor&#383;e off than
ever."]&mdash;<i>"Tais toi, tais tois,"</i> ["Be quiet, I tell
you."] (&#383;ays the old man, who &#383;eemed the lea&#383;t
garrulous of the two.)&mdash;<i>"Ne crains rien,</i> ["Never
fear."] (replied the fir&#383;t,) <i>c'e&#383;t de braves gens;</i>
the&#383;e ladies and gentlemen I'm &#383;ure are good people; they
have not the look of patriots."&mdash;And with this compliment to
our&#383;elves, and the externals of patrioti&#383;m, we took our
leave of them.</p>
<p>I found, however, by this little conver&#383;ation, that
&#383;ome of the pea&#383;ant&#383; &#383;till believe they are to
have the lands of the gentry divided among&#383;t them, according
to a decree for that purpo&#383;e. The lady, whom they lamented,
and who&#383;e e&#383;tate they expected to &#383;hare, was the
Marqui&#383;e de B____, who had really left the country before the
revolution, and had gone to drink &#383;ome of the German mineral
waters, but not returning within the time afterwards
pre&#383;cribed, was declared an emigrant. By means of a friend,
&#383;he got an application made to Chabot, (then in high
popularity,) who for an hundred thou&#383;and livres procured a
pa&#383;&#383;port from the Executive Council to enter France. Upon
the faith of this &#383;he ventured to return, and was in
con&#383;equence, notwith&#383;tanding her pa&#383;&#383;port,
executed as an emigrant.</p>
<p>Mrs. D____, who is not yet well enough for &#383;uch an
expedition, and is, be&#383;ides, unaccu&#383;tomed to our
montures, remained at home. We found &#383;he had been much alarmed
during our ab&#383;ence, every hou&#383;e in the village having
been &#383;earched, by order of the di&#383;trict, for corn, and
two of the hor&#383;es taken to the next po&#383;t to convey the
retinue of the Deputy we had &#383;een in the morning. Every thing,
however, was tranquil on our arrival, and rejoicing it was no
wor&#383;e, though Mons. ____ &#383;eemed to be under great
apprehen&#383;ion for his hor&#383;es, we &#383;at down to what in
France is called a late dinner.</p>
<p>Our ho&#383;t's brother, who left the army at the general
exclu&#383;ion of the Noble&#383;&#383;e, and was in confinement at
the Luxembourg until after the death of Robe&#383;pierre, is a
profe&#383;&#383;ed wit, writes couplets to popular airs, and has
dramatized one of Plutarch's Lives. While we were at the
de&#383;ert, he amu&#383;ed us with &#383;ome of his
compo&#383;itions in pri&#383;on, &#383;uch as an epigram on the
Guillotine, half a dozen calembours on the bad fare at the
<i>Gamelle,</i> [Me&#383;s.] and an ode on the republican victory
at Fleuru&#383;&mdash;the la&#383;t written under the hourly
expectation of being &#383;ent off with the next <i>fournee</i>
(batch) of pretended con&#383;pirators, yet breathing the mo&#383;t
ardent attachment to the convention, and terminated by a full
&#383;ounding line about tyrants and liberty.&mdash;This may appear
&#383;trange, but the Poets were, for the mo&#383;t part, in
durance, and the Mu&#383;es mu&#383;t &#383;ing, though in a cage:
hope and fear too both in&#383;pire pre&#383;criptively, and
freedom might be obtained or death averted by the&#383;e
effu&#383;ions of a devotion &#383;o profound a&#383; not to be
alienated by the &#383;ufferings of impri&#383;onment, or the
menace of de&#383;truction. Whole volumes of little jeux
d'e&#383;prit, written under the&#383;e circum&#383;tances, might
be collected from the different pri&#383;ons; and, I believe, it is
only in France that &#383;uch a collection could have been
furni&#383;hed.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Many of the&#383;e poetical trifles have been
publi&#383;hed&mdash;&#383;ome written even the night before their
authors were executed. There are &#383;everal of great poetical
merit, and, when con&#383;idered relatively, are
wonderful.&mdash;Among the various poets impri&#383;oned, was one
we &#383;hould &#383;carcely have expected&mdash;Rouget Delille,
author of the Mar&#383;eillois Hymn, who, while his mu&#383;e was
rouzing the citizens from one end of the republic to the other to
arm again&#383;t tyrants, wa&#383; him&#383;elf langui&#383;hing
ob&#383;curely a victim to the wor&#383;t of all
tyrannies.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. D____, though he writes and &#383;peaks French admirably,
does not love French ver&#383;es; and I found he could not depend
on the government of hi&#383; features, while a French poet was
reciting his own, but kept his eye&#383; fixed on a dried apple,
which he pared very curiou&#383;ly, and when that wa&#383;
atchieved, betook him&#383;elf to breaking pralines, and extracting
the almonds with equal application. We, however, complimented
Mon&#383;ieur'&#383; poetry; and when we had taken our coffee, and
the &#383;ervants were entirely withdrawn, he read us &#383;ome
trifles more agreeable to our principles, if not to our ta&#383;te,
and in which the Convention was treated with more &#383;incerity
than complai&#383;ance. It &#383;eems the poet's zeal for the
republic had vani&#383;hed at his departure from the Luxembourg,
and that his wrath again&#383;t coale&#383;ced de&#383;pots, and
his pa&#383;&#383;ion for liberty, had entirely evaporated. In the
evening we played a party of rever&#383;i with republican cards,*
and heard the children &#383;ing "Mourrons pour la Patrie."</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The four Kings are replaced by four Genii, the Queens
by four &#383;orts of liberty, and the Knaves by four
de&#383;criptions of equality.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;After the&#383;e civic amu&#383;ements, we clo&#383;ed
our chairs round the fire, conjecturing how long the republic might
la&#383;t, or whether we &#383;hould all pa&#383;s another twelve
months in pri&#383;on, and, agreeing that both our fate and that of
the republic were very precarious, adjourned to re&#383;t.</p>
<p>While I was undre&#383;&#383;ing, I ob&#383;erved Angelique
looked extremely di&#383;contented, and on my enquiring what was
the matter, &#383;he an&#383;wered, <i>"C'e&#383;t que je m'ennuie
beaucoup ici,"</i> ["I am quite tired of thi&#383; place."]
"Mademoi&#383;elle," (for no &#383;tate or calling is here exempt
from thi&#383; polite &#383;en&#383;ation.) "And why,
pray?"&mdash;<i>"Ah quelle tri&#383;te &#383;ociete, tout le monde
e&#383;t d'un patrioti&#383;me in&#383;outenable, la mai&#383;on
e&#383;t remplie d'image&#383; republicaines, des Marat, des
Voltaire, des Pelletier, que &#383;ais-moi? et voila ju&#383;qu'au
garcon de l'ecurie qui me traite de citoyenne."</i> ["Oh, they are
a &#383;ad &#383;et&mdash;every body is &#383;o in&#383;ufferably
patriotic. The hou&#383;e is full from top to bottom of republican
images, Marats, and Voltaires, and Pelletiers, and I don't know
who&mdash;and I am called Citizen even by the &#383;table boy."] I
did not think it right to &#383;ati&#383;fy her as to the real
principles of our friends, and went to bed ruminating on the
improvement&#383; which the revolution mu&#383;t have
occa&#383;ioned in the art of di&#383;&#383;imulation. Terror has
drilled people of the mo&#383;t oppo&#383;ite &#383;entiments into
&#383;uch an uniformity of manner and expre&#383;&#383;ion, that an
ari&#383;tocrat who is ruined and per&#383;ecuted by the government
is not di&#383;tingui&#383;hable from the Jacobin who has made his
fortune under it.</p>
<p>In the morning Angelique's countenance was brightened, and I
found &#383;he had &#383;lept in the &#383;ame room with Madame's
<i>femme de chambre,</i> when an explanation of their political
creeds had taken place, &#383;o that &#383;he now a&#383;&#383;ured
me Mad. Augu&#383;tine was <i>"fort honnete dans le fond,"</i> [A
very good girl at heart.] though &#383;he was obliged to affect
republicani&#383;m.&mdash;"All the world's a &#383;tage," &#383;ays
our great dramatic morali&#383;t. France is certainly &#383;o at
pre&#383;ent, and we are not only nece&#383;&#383;itated to act a
part, but a &#383;orry one too; for we have no choice but to
exhibit in farce, or &#383;uffer in tragedy.&mdash;Yours,
&amp;c.</p>

<h2>December 27, 1794.</h2>
<p>I took the opportunity of my being here to go about four leagues
farther to &#383;ee an old convent acquaintance lately come to this
part of the country, and whom I have not met &#383;ince I was at
Orleans in 1789.</p>
<p>The time has been when I &#383;hould have thought &#383;uch a
hi&#383;tory as thi&#383; lady's a romance, but tales of woe are
now become familiar to us, and, if they create &#383;ympathy, they
no longer excite &#383;urprize, and we hear of them as the natural
effects of the revolution.</p>
<p>Madame de St. E__m__d is the daughter of a gentleman who&#383;e
fortune wa&#383; inadequate both to his rank and manner of living,
and he gladly embraced the offer of Mon&#383;ieur de St. E__m__d to
marry her at &#383;ixteen, and to relinqui&#383;h the fortune
allotted her to her two younger &#383;i&#383;ters. Mon&#383;ieur de
St. E__m__d, being a di&#383;&#383;ipated man, &#383;oon grew weary
of any &#383;ort of dome&#383;tic life, and placing his wife with
her father, in le&#383;s than a year after their marriage departed
for Italy.&mdash;Madame de St. E__m__d, thu&#383; left in a
&#383;ituation both delicate and dangerous for a young and pretty
woman, became unfortunately attached to a gentleman who was her
di&#383;tant relation: yet, far from adopting the immoral
principles not unju&#383;tly a&#383;cribed to your country,
&#383;he conducted her&#383;elf with a prudence and re&#383;erve,
which even in France made her an object of general re&#383;pect.
About three years after her hu&#383;band's departure the revolution
took place, and not returning, he was of cour&#383;e put on the
li&#383;t of emigrants. In 1792, when the law pa&#383;&#383;ed
which &#383;anctioned and facilitated divorces, her friends all
earne&#383;tly per&#383;uaded her to avail her&#383;elf of it, but
&#383;he could not be prevailed upon to con&#383;ider the &#383;tep
as ju&#383;tifiable; for though Mon&#383;ieur de St. E__m__d
neglected her, he had, in other re&#383;pects, treated her with
genero&#383;ity and kindne&#383;s. She, therefore,
per&#383;i&#383;ted in her refu&#383;al, and her lover, in
de&#383;pair, joined the republican army.</p>
<p>At the general arre&#383;t of the Noble&#383;&#383;e, Madame de
St. E__m__d and her &#383;i&#383;ters were confined in the town
where they re&#383;ided, but their father was &#383;ent to Paris;
and a letter from one of his female relations, who had emigrated,
being found among his papers, he was executed without being able to
&#383;ee or write to his children. Madame de St. E__m__d's
hu&#383;band had returned about the &#383;ame time to France, in
the di&#383;gui&#383;e of a po&#383;t-boy, was di&#383;covered, and
&#383;hared the &#383;ame fate. The&#383;e events reached her love,
&#383;till at the army, but it was impo&#383;&#383;ible for him to
quit his po&#383;t, and in a few days after, being mortally
wounded, he died,* recommending Eugenie de St. E__m__d to the
protection of his father.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This young man, who died gallantly fighting in the
cau&#383;e of the republic, was no republican: but this does not
render the murder of his father, a deaf [There were people both
deaf and dumb in the pri&#383;ons as con&#383;pirators.] and
inoffen&#383;ive man, le&#383;s abominable.&mdash;The ca&#383;e of
General Moreau's father, though &#383;omewhat &#383;imilar, is yet
more characteri&#383;tic of the revolution. Mons. Moreau was
per&#383;uaded, by a man who had &#383;ome intere&#383;t in the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s, to pay a debt which he owed an emigrant, to an
individual, in&#383;tead of paying it, as the law directed, to the
u&#383;e of the republic. The &#383;ame man afterward&#383;
denounced him, and he was thrown into pri&#383;on. At nine o'clock
on the night preceding his trial, his act of accu&#383;ation was
brought him, and before he had time to &#383;ketch out a few lines
for hi&#383; defence, the light by which he wrote was taken away.
In the morning he was tried, the man who had informed again&#383;t
him &#383;itting as one of his judges, and he was condemned and
executed the very day on which his &#383;on took the Fort de
l'Eclu&#383;e!&mdash;Mons. Moreau had four &#383;ons, be&#383;ides
the General in the army, and two daughters, all left de&#383;titute
by the confi&#383;cation of his property.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;A brother officer, who engaged to execute this
commi&#383;&#383;ion, wrote immediately to the old man, to inform
him of his lo&#383;s, and of his &#383;on'&#383; la&#383;t
reque&#383;t. It was too late, the father having been arre&#383;ted
on &#383;u&#383;picion, and afterwards guillotined, with many other
per&#383;ons, for a pretended con&#383;piracy in pri&#383;on, the
very day on which his &#383;on had fallen in the performance of an
act of uncommon bravery.</p>
<p>Were I writing from imagination, I &#383;hould add, that Madame
de St. E__m__d had been unable to &#383;u&#383;tain the &#383;hock
of the&#383;e repeated calamities, and that her life or
under&#383;tanding had been the &#383;acrifice. It were, indeed,
happy for the &#383;ufferer, if our days were always terminated
when they became embittered, or that we lo&#383;t the
&#383;en&#383;e of &#383;orrow by its exce&#383;s: but it is not
&#383;o&mdash;we continue to exi&#383;t when we have lo&#383;t the
de&#383;ire of exi&#383;tence, and to rea&#383;on when feeling and
rea&#383;on con&#383;titute our torments. Madame de St. E__m__d
then lives, but lives in affliction; and having collected the wreck
of her per&#383;onal property, which &#383;ome friends had
concealed, &#383;he left the part of France &#383;he formerly
inhabited, and is now with an aunt in this neighbourhood, watching
the decay of her elde&#383;t &#383;i&#383;ter, and educating the
younge&#383;t.</p>
<p>Clementine was con&#383;umptive when they were fir&#383;t
arre&#383;ted, and vexation, with ill-treatment in the pri&#383;on,
have &#383;o e&#383;tabli&#383;hed her di&#383;order, that &#383;he
is now pa&#383;t relief. She is yet &#383;carcely eighteen, and one
of the mo&#383;t lovely young women I ever &#383;aw. Grief and
&#383;ickne&#383;s have ravaged her features; but they are
&#383;till &#383;o perfect, that fancy, a&#383;&#383;ociating their
pa&#383;t bloom with their pre&#383;ent languor, &#383;upplies
perhaps as much to the mind as is lo&#383;t by the eye. She
&#383;uffers without complaining, and mourn&#383; without
o&#383;tentation; and hears her father &#383;poken of with
&#383;uch &#383;olemn &#383;ilent floods of tears, that &#383;he
looks like the original of Dryden'&#383; beautiful portrait of the
weeping Sigi&#383;munda.</p>
<p>The letter which condemned the father of the&#383;e ladies, was
not, it &#383;eems, written to him&#383;elf, but to a brother,
lately dead, who&#383;e executor he was, and of who&#383;e papers
he thus became po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed. On this ground their
friends engaged them to petition the A&#383;&#383;embly for a
revi&#383;ion of the &#383;entence, and the re&#383;toration of
their property, which was in con&#383;equence forfeited.</p>
<p>The daily profe&#383;&#383;ions of the Convention, in favour of
ju&#383;tice and humanity, and the return of the &#383;eventy-three
impri&#383;oned Deputies, had &#383;oothed the&#383;e poor young
women with the hopes of regaining their paternal inheritance,
&#383;o iniquitou&#383;ly confi&#383;cated. A petition was,
therefore, forwarded to Paris about a fortnight ago; and the day
before, the following decree was i&#383;&#383;ued, which has
&#383;ilenced their claims for ever: "La Convention Nationale
declare qu'elle n'admettra aucune demande en revi&#383;ion des
jugemens criminels portant confi&#383;cation de biens rendus et
executes pendant la revolution."*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* "The National Convention hereby declares that it will
admit no petitions for the revi&#383;al of &#383;uch criminal
&#383;entences, attended with confi&#383;cation of property, as
have been pa&#383;&#383;ed and executed &#383;ince the revolution."
Yet the&#383;e revolutioni&#383;ts, who would hear nothing of
repairing their own inju&#383;tice, had occa&#383;ionally been
annulling &#383;entences pa&#383;t half a century ago, and the more
recent one of the Chevalier La Barre. But their own executions and
confi&#383;cations for an adherence to religion were to be held
&#383;acred.&mdash;I &#383;hall be excu&#383;ed for introducing
here a few words re&#383;pecting the affair of La Barre, which has
been a favourite topic with popular writers of a certain
de&#383;cription. The &#383;everity of the puni&#383;hment
mu&#383;t, doubtle&#383;s, be con&#383;idered a&#383;
di&#383;graceful to tho&#383;e who advi&#383;ed as well as to
tho&#383;e who &#383;anctioned it: but we mu&#383;t not infer from
hence that he merited no puni&#383;hment at all; and perhaps
degradation, &#383;ome &#383;candalous and public correction, with
a few years &#383;olitary confinement, might have an&#383;wered
every purpo&#383;e intended. La Barre was a young etourdi, under
twenty, but of lively talents, which, unfortunately for him, had
taken a very perver&#383;e turn. The mi&#383;demeanour commonly
imputed to him and his a&#383;&#383;ociates was, that they had
mutilated a Chri&#383;t which &#383;tood on the Pont-neuf at
Abbeville: but La Barre had accu&#383;tomed him&#383;elf to take
all opportunities of in&#383;ulting, with the mo&#383;t wanton
malignity, the&#383;e pious repre&#383;entations, and
e&#383;pecially in the pre&#383;ence of people, with whom his
particular connections led him to a&#383;&#383;ociate, and
who&#383;e profe&#383;&#383;ion could not allow them entirely to
overlook &#383;uch affront&#383; on what was deemed an appendage to
the e&#383;tabli&#383;hed religion of the country. The people of
Abbeville manife&#383;ted their &#383;en&#383;e of the
bu&#383;ine&#383;s when d'Etalonde, La Barre's intimate friend, who
had &#383;aved him&#383;elf by flight, returned, after a long
exile, under favour of the revolution. He was received in the
neighbourhood with the mo&#383;t mortifying indifference. The
decree of the Convention too, by which the memory of thi&#383;
imprudent young man was re-e&#383;tabli&#383;hed, when promulgated,
created about as much intere&#383;t as any other law which did not
immediately affect the property or awaken the apprehen&#383;ions of
the hearers.</blockquote>

<p>Madame de St. E__m__d told me her whole fortune was now reduced
to a few Louis, and about &#383;ix or &#383;even thou&#383;and
livres in diamonds; that &#383;he wa&#383; unwilling to burden her
aunt, who was not rich, and intended to make &#383;ome advantage of
her mu&#383;ical talents, which are indeed con&#383;iderable. But I
could not, without angui&#383;h, hear an elegant young woman, with
a heart half broken, propo&#383;e to get her living by teaching
mu&#383;ic.&mdash;I know not that I ever pa&#383;&#383;ed a more
melancholy day. In the afternoon we walked up and down the path of
the village church-yard. The church was &#383;hut up, the roof in
part untiled, the windows were broken, and the wooden
cro&#383;&#383;e&#383; that religion or tenderne&#383;s had erected
to commemorate the dead, broken and &#383;cattered about. Two
labourers, and a black-&#383;mith in his working garb, came while
we were there, and threw a &#383;ort of uncouth wooden coffin
ha&#383;tily into a hole dug for the purpo&#383;e, which they then
covered and left without farther ceremony. Yet this was the body of
a lady regretted by a large family, who were thus obliged to
conquer both their affection and their prejudices, and inter her
according to the republican mode.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The relations or friends of the dead were prohibited,
under &#383;evere penalties, from following their remains to the
grave.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought, while we traver&#383;ed the walk, and beheld this
&#383;cene, that every thing about me bore the marks of the
revolution. The melancholy object&#383; I held on my arm, and the
feeble &#383;teps of Clementine, whom we could &#383;carcely
&#383;upport, aided the impre&#383;&#383;ion; and I fear that, for
the moment, I que&#383;tioned the ju&#383;tice of Heaven, in
permitting &#383;uch a &#383;courge to be let loo&#383;e upon its
works.</p>
<p>I quitted Madame de St. E__m__d this morning with reluctance,
for we &#383;hall not meet again till I am entirely at liberty. The
village municipality where &#383;he now re&#383;ides, are quiet and
civil, and her mi&#383;fortunes make her fearful of attracting the
notice of the people in authority of a large place, &#383;o that
&#383;he cannot venture to Amiens.&mdash;You mu&#383;t
ob&#383;erve, that any per&#383;on who has &#383;uffered is an
object of particular &#383;u&#383;picion, and that to have had a
father or a hu&#383;band executed, and to be reduced to beggary,
are titles to farther per&#383;ecution.&mdash;The politics of the
day are, it is true, &#383;omething le&#383;s ferocious than they
were: but confidence is not to be re&#383;tored by an
e&#383;&#383;ay in the Orateur du Peuple,* or an equivocal harangue
from the tribune; and I perceive every where, that tho&#383;e who
have been mo&#383;t injured, are mo&#383;t timid.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* <i>"L'Orateur du Peuple,"</i> was a periodical paper
publi&#383;hed by Freron, many numbers of which were written with
great &#383;pirit.&mdash; Freron was at this time
&#383;uppo&#383;ed to have become a royali&#383;t, and hi&#383;
paper, which was comparatively favourable to the ari&#383;tocrats,
wa&#383; read with great eagerne&#383;s. The following extract from
the regi&#383;ters of one of the popular commi&#383;&#383;ions will
prove, that the fears of tho&#383;e who had already &#383;uffered
by the revolution were well founded: "A. Sourdeville, and A. N. E.
Sourdeville, &#383;i&#383;ters of an emigrant Noble, daughters of a
Count, ari&#383;tocrats, and having had their father and brother
guillotined. "M. J. Sourdeville, mother of an emigrant, an
ari&#383;tocrat, and her hu&#383;band and &#383;on having been
guillotined. "Jean Marie Defille&mdash;very
&#383;u&#383;piciou&#383;&mdash;a partizan of the Abbe Arnoud and
La Fayette, has had a brother guillotined, and always &#383;hewn
him&#383;elf indifferent about the public welfare." The
commi&#383;&#383;ions declare that the above are condemned to
bani&#383;hment.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not reach this place till after the family had dined, and
taking my &#383;oup and a di&#383;h of coffee, have e&#383;caped,
under pretext of the headache, to my own room. I left our poet far
gone in a cla&#383;&#383;ical de&#383;cription of a &#383;ort of
Roman dre&#383;&#383;es, the drawings of which he had &#383;een
exhibited at the Lyceum, as models of an intended national
equipment for the French citizens of both &#383;exes; and my
vi&#383;it to Madame de St. E__m__d had incapacitated me for
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ing revolutionary draperies.</p>
<p>In England, this is the &#383;ea&#383;on of fe&#383;tivity to
the little, and beneficence in the great; but here, the
&#383;terile genius of athei&#383;m ha&#383;
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed the &#383;ounds of mirth, and clo&#383;ed
the hands of charity&mdash;no &#383;ea&#383;on is con&#383;ecrated
either to the one or the other; and the once-varied year is but an
uniform round of gloom and &#383;elfi&#383;hne&#383;s. The
philo&#383;opher may treat with contempt the notion of periodical
benevolence, and a&#383;&#383;ert that we &#383;hould not wait to
be reminded by religion or the calendar, in order to contribute to
the relief of our fellow creatures: yet there are people who are
influenced by cu&#383;tom and duty, that are not always awake to
compa&#383;&#383;ion; and indolence or avarice may yield a too
ready obedience to prohibitions which favour both. The poor are
certainly no gainers by the &#383;ub&#383;titution of
philo&#383;ophy for religion; and many of tho&#383;e who are
forbidden to celebrate Chri&#383;tmas or Ea&#383;ter by a
ma&#383;s, will forget to do it by a donation. For my own part, I
think it an advantage that any period of the year is more
particularly &#383;ignalized by charity; and I rejoice when I hear
of the annual gifts of meat or firing of &#383;uch, or &#383;uch a
great per&#383;onage&mdash;and I never enquire whether they might
&#383;till continue their munificence if Chri&#383;tianity were
aboli&#383;hed.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h2>Amiens, Jan. 23, 1795.</h2>
<p>Nothing proves more that the French republican government was
originally founded on principles of de&#383;poti&#383;m and
inju&#383;tice, than the weakne&#383;s and anarchy which &#383;eem
to accompany every deviation from the&#383;e principles. It is
&#383;trong to de&#383;troy and weak to protect: becau&#383;e,
deriving it&#383; &#383;upport from the power of the bad and the
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion of the timid, it i&#383; de&#383;erted or
oppo&#383;ed by the former when it cea&#383;es to plunder or
oppre&#383;&#383;&mdash; while the fears and habits of the latter
&#383;till prevail, and render them as unwilling to defend a better
&#383;y&#383;tem as they have been to re&#383;i&#383;t the
wor&#383;t po&#383;&#383;ible.</p>
<p>The reforms that have taken place &#383;ince the death of
Robe&#383;pierre, though not &#383;ufficient for the demands of
ju&#383;tice, are yet enough to relax the &#383;trength of the
government; and the Jacobins, though excluded from authority, yet
influence by the turbulence of their chiefs in the Convention, and
the recollection of their pa&#383;t tyranny&mdash;again&#383;t the
return of which the fluctuating politics of the A&#383;&#383;embly
offer no &#383;ecurity. The Committees of Public Welfare and
General Safety (who&#383;e members were intended, according to the
original in&#383;titution, to be removed monthly) were, under
Robe&#383;pierre, perpetual; and the union they pre&#383;erved in
certain points, however unfavourable to liberty, gave a vigour to
the government, of which from its conformation it &#383;hould
appear to have been incapable. It is now di&#383;covered, that an
undefined power, not &#383;ubject to the re&#383;triction of fixed
laws, cannot remain long in the &#383;ame hands without producing
tyranny. A fourth part of the Members of the&#383;e Committees are,
therefore, now changed every month; but thi&#383; regulation, more
advantageous to the Convention than the people, keep&#383; alive
animo&#383;ities, &#383;timulates ambition, and retains the country
in anxiety and &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;e; for no one can gue&#383;s
this month what &#383;y&#383;tem may be adopted the next&mdash;and
the admi&#383;&#383;ion of two or three new Jacobin member&#383;
would be &#383;ufficient to excite an univer&#383;al alarm.</p>
<p>We watch the&#383;e renewals with a &#383;olicitude
inconceivable to tho&#383;e who &#383;tudy politics as they do a
new opera, and have nothing to apprehend from the per&#383;onal
characters of Mini&#383;ters; and our hopes and fears vary
according as the members elected are Moderates, Doubtfuls, or
decided Mountaineers.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* For in&#383;tance, Carnot, who&#383;e talents in the
military department obliged the Convention (even if they had not
been &#383;o di&#383;po&#383;ed) to forget his compliances with
Robe&#383;pierre, his friend&#383;hip for Barrere and Collot, and
his eulogiums on Carrier.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;This mixture of principles, which intrigue, intimidation,
or expediency, occa&#383;ions in the Committees, is felt daily; and
if the languor and ver&#383;atility of the government be not more
apparent, it i&#383; that habits of &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion
&#383;till continue, and that the force of terror operates in the
branches, though the main &#383;pring be relaxed. Were armie&#383;
to be rai&#383;ed, or means devi&#383;ed to pay them now, it could
not be done; though, being once put in motion, they continue to
act, and the requi&#383;itions &#383;till in a certain degree
&#383;upply them.</p>
<p>The Convention, while they have lo&#383;t much of their real
power, have al&#383;o become more externally contemptible than
ever. When they were overawed by the impo&#383;ing tone of their
Committees, they were tolerably decent; but as this re&#383;traint
has worn off, the &#383;candalous tumult of their debate&#383;
increa&#383;es, and they exhibit whatever you can imagine of an
a&#383;&#383;emblage of men, mo&#383;t of whom are probably
unacquainted with tho&#383;e &#383;alutary form&#383; which correct
the pa&#383;&#383;ions, and &#383;often the intercour&#383;e of
poli&#383;hed &#383;ociety. They que&#383;tion each other's
veracity with a frankne&#383;s truly democratic, and come
fraternally to "Touch&#383;tone's &#383;eventh remove" at once,
without pa&#383;&#383;ing any of the intermediate
progre&#383;&#383;ions. It was but lately that one Ga&#383;ton
advanced with a &#383;tick in full a&#383;&#383;embly to
thre&#383;h Legendre; and Cambon and Duhem are &#383;ometimes
obliged to be holden by the arms and legs, to prevent their falling
on Tallien and Freron. I de&#383;cribed &#383;cenes of this nature
to you at the opening of the Convention; but I a&#383;&#383;ure
you, the &#383;ilent meditations of the members under
Robe&#383;pierre have extremely improved them in that &#383;pecies
of eloquence, which is not &#383;u&#383;ceptible of
tran&#383;lation or tran&#383;cription. We may conclude, that
the&#383;e licences are inherent to a perfect democracy; for the
greater the number of repre&#383;entatives, and the nearer they
approach to the ma&#383;s of the people, the le&#383;s they will be
influenced by ari&#383;tocratic ceremonials. We have, however, no
intere&#383;t in di&#383;puting the right of the Convention to
u&#383;e violence and lavi&#383;h abu&#383;e among&#383;t
them&#383;elves; for, perhaps, the&#383;e &#383;cenes form the only
part of their journals which does not record or applaud &#383;ome
real mi&#383;chief.</p>
<p>The French, who are obliged to celebrate &#383;o many aeras of
revolution, who have demoli&#383;hed Ba&#383;tilles and
de&#383;troyed tyrants, &#383;eem at this moment to be in a
political infancy, &#383;truggling again&#383;t
de&#383;poti&#383;m, and emerging from ignorance and barbarity. A
per&#383;on unacquainted with the promoter&#383; and objects of the
revolution, might be apt to enquire for what it had been
undertaken, or what had been gained by it, when all the
manufactured eloquence of Tallien is vainly exerted to obtain
&#383;ome limitation of arbitrary impri&#383;onment&mdash;when
Freron harangues with equal labour and a&#383; little
&#383;ucce&#383;s in behalf of the liberty of the pre&#383;s; while
Gregoire pleads for freedom of wor&#383;hip, Echa&#383;&#383;eriaux
for that of commerce, and all the &#383;ections of Paris for that
of election.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It is to be ob&#383;erved, that in the&#383;e
orations all the decree&#383; pa&#383;&#383;ed by the Convention
for the de&#383;truction of commerce and religion, are
a&#383;cribed to the influence of Mr. Pitt.&mdash;"La
libertede&#383; cultes exi&#383;te en Turquie, elle n'exi&#383;te
point en France. Le peuple y e&#383;t prive d'un droit donc on
jouit dans les etats de&#383;potique&#383; memes, &#383;ous les
regences de Maroc et d'Algers. Si cet etat de cho&#383;es doit
per&#383;everer, ne parlons plus de l'inqui&#383;ition, nous en
avons perdu le droit, car la liberte des cultes n'e&#383;t que dans
le&#383; decrets, et la per&#383;ecution tiraille toute la France.
"Cette impre&#383;&#383;ion intolerante aurait elle ete
(&#383;uggeree) par le cabinet de St. James?" "In Turkey the
liberty of wor&#383;hip is admitted, though it does not exi&#383;t
in France. Here the people are deprived of a right common to the
mo&#383;t de&#383;potic governments, not even excepting tho&#383;e
of Algier&#383; and Morocco.&mdash;If things are to continue in
this &#383;tate, let us &#383;ay no more about the
Inqui&#383;ition, we have no right, for religious liberty is to be
found only in our decrees, while, in truth, the whole country is
expo&#383;ed to per&#383;ecution. "May not the&#383;e intolerant
notions have been &#383;ugge&#383;ted by the Cabinet of St. James?"
Gregoire's Report on the Liberty of Wor&#383;hip.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Thus, after &#383;o many years of &#383;uffering, and
&#383;uch a wa&#383;te of whatever i&#383; mo&#383;t valuable, the
civil, religious, and political privileges of thi&#383; country
depend on a vote of the Convention.</p>
<p>The &#383;peech of Gregoire, which tended to re&#383;tore the
Catholic wor&#383;hip, wa&#383; very ill received by his
colleagues, but every where el&#383;e it is read with avidity and
applau&#383;e; for, exclu&#383;ive of its merit as a
compo&#383;ition, the &#383;ubject is of general intere&#383;t, and
there are few who do not wi&#383;h to have the pre&#383;ent puerile
imitations of Pagani&#383;m replaced by Chri&#383;tianity. The
A&#383;&#383;embly li&#383;tened to this tolerating oration with
impatience, pa&#383;&#383;ed to the order of the day, and called
loudly for Decades, with celebrations in honour of "the liberty of
the world, po&#383;terity, &#383;toici&#383;m, the republic, and
the hatred of tyrant&#383;!" But the people, who under&#383;tand
nothing of this new wor&#383;hip, langui&#383;h after the
&#383;aints of their ance&#383;tors, and think St. Francois
d'A&#383;&#383;i&#383;e, or St. Francois de Sales, at lea&#383;t as
likely to afford them &#383;piritual con&#383;olation, as
Carmagnoles, political homilies, or pa&#383;teboard
godde&#383;&#383;es of liberty.</p>
<p>The failure of Gregoire is far from operating as a
di&#383;couragement to thi&#383; mode of thinking; for &#383;uch
has been the intolerance of the la&#383;t year, that his having
even ventured to &#383;ugge&#383;t a declaration in favour of free
wor&#383;hip, is deemed a &#383;ort of triumph to the pious which
has revived their hopes. Nothing is talked of but the
re&#383;toration of churches, and rein&#383;talment of
prie&#383;t&#383;&mdash;the &#383;hops are already open on the
Decade, and the decrees of the Convention, which make a principal
part of the republican &#383;ervice, are now read only to a few
idle children or bare walls. [When the bell toll'd on the Decade,
the people u&#383;ed to &#383;ay it wa&#383; for La me&#383;&#383;e
du Diable&mdash;The Devil's ma&#383;s.]&mdash;My maid told me this
morning, as a &#383;ecret of too much importance for her to retain,
that &#383;he had the promi&#383;e of being introduced to a good
prie&#383;t, (un bon pretre, for &#383;o the people entitle
tho&#383;e who have never conformed,) to receive her
confe&#383;&#383;ion at Ea&#383;ter; and the fetes of the new
calendar are now je&#383;ted on publicly with very little
reverence.</p>
<p>The Convention have very lately decreed them&#383;elves an
increa&#383;e of pay, from eighteen to thirty-&#383;ix livres.
This, according to the comparative value of a&#383;&#383;ignats, is
very trifling: but the people, who have &#383;o long been flattered
with the ideas of partition and equality, and are now
&#383;tarving, con&#383;ider it as a great deal, and much
di&#383;content is excited, which however evaporates, as
u&#383;ual, in the national talent for bon mots. The augmentation,
though an object of popular jealou&#383;y, is mo&#383;t likely
valued by the leading members only as it procures them an
o&#383;ten&#383;ible means of living; for all who have been on
mi&#383;&#383;ions, or had any &#383;hare in the government, have,
like Fal&#383;taff, "hid their honour in their
nece&#383;&#383;ities," and have now re&#383;ources they
de&#383;ire to profit by, but cannot decently avow.</p>
<p>The Jacobin party have in general oppo&#383;ed this additional
eighteen livres, with the hope of ca&#383;ting an odium on their
adver&#383;aries; but the people, though they murmur, &#383;till
prefer the Moderates, even at the expence of paying the difference.
The policy of &#383;ome Deputies who have acquired too much, or the
malice of others who have acquired nothing, ha&#383; frequently
propo&#383;ed, that every member of the Convention &#383;hould
publi&#383;h an account of his fortune before and &#383;ince the
revolution. An enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic and acclamatory decree of
a&#383;&#383;ent has always in&#383;ued; but &#383;omehow prudence
has hitherto cooled this warmth before the &#383;ub&#383;equent
debate, and the re&#383;olution has never yet been carried into
effect.</p>
<p>The crimes of Maignet, though they appear to occa&#383;ion but
little regret in his colleagues, have been the &#383;ource of
con&#383;iderable embarra&#383;&#383;ment to them. When he was on
mi&#383;&#383;ion in the department of Vauclu&#383;e,
be&#383;ide&#383; numberle&#383;s other enormities, he cau&#383;ed
the whole town of Bedouin to be burnt, a part of its inhabitants to
be guillotined, and the re&#383;t di&#383;per&#383;ed, becau&#383;e
the tree of liberty was cut down one dark night, while they were
a&#383;leep.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Maignet's order for the burning of Bedouin begins
thus: "Liberte, egalite, au nom du peuple Francai&#383;!" He then
&#383;tates the offence of the inhabitants in &#383;uffering the
tree of liberty to be cut down, in&#383;titutes a
commi&#383;&#383;ion for trying them, and proceed&#383;&mdash;"It
is hereby ordered, that as &#383;oon as the principal criminals are
executed, the national agent &#383;hall notify to the remaining
inhabitants not confined, that they are enjoined to evacuate their
dwellings, and take out their effects in twenty-four hours; at the
expiration of which he is to commit the town to the flames, and
leave no ve&#383;tige of a building &#383;tanding. Farther, it is
forbidden to erect any building on the &#383;pot in future, or to
cultivate the &#383;oil." "Done at Avignon, the 17th Floreal." The
decree of the Convention to the &#383;ame effect pa&#383;&#383;ed
about the 1&#383;t of Floreal. Merlin de Douai, (Mini&#383;ter of
Ju&#383;tice in 1796,) Legendre, and Bourdon de l'Oi&#383;e, were
the zealous defenders of Maignet on this
occa&#383;ion.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Since the A&#383;&#383;embly have thought it expedient to
di&#383;avow the&#383;e revolutionary mea&#383;ures, the conduct of
Maignet has been denounced, and the accu&#383;ations again&#383;t
him &#383;ent to a commi&#383;&#383;ion to be examined. For a long
time no report was made, till the impatience of Rovere, who i&#383;
Maignet's per&#383;onal enemy, rendered a publication of the
re&#383;ult di&#383;pen&#383;able. They declared they found no room
for cen&#383;ure or farther proceedings. This deci&#383;ion was at
fir&#383;t &#383;trongly reprobated by the Moderates; but as it was
proved, in the cour&#383;e of the debate, that Maignet was
authorized, by an expre&#383;s decree of the Convention, to burn
Bedouin, and guillotine its inhabitants, all parties &#383;oon
agreed to con&#383;ign the whole to oblivion.</p>
<p>Our clothes, &amp;c. are at length entirely relea&#383;ed from
&#383;eque&#383;tration, and the &#383;eals taken off. We are
indebted for this act of ju&#383;tice to the intrigues of Tallien,
who&#383;e belle E&#383;pagnole is con&#383;iderably
intere&#383;ted. Tallien's good fortune is &#383;o much envied,
that &#383;ome of the members were little enough to move, that the
property of the Spani&#383;h Bank of St. Charles (in which Madame
T&mdash;&mdash;'s is included) &#383;hould be excepted from the
decree in favour of foreigners. The Convention were weak enough to
accede; but the exception will, doubtle&#383;s, be over-ruled.</p>
<p>The weather is &#383;evere beyond what it has been in my
remembrance. The thermometer was this morning at fourteen and a
half. It is, be&#383;ides, potentially cold, and every particle of
air is like a dart.&mdash;I &#383;uppo&#383;e you contrive to keep
your&#383;elves warm in England, though it is not
po&#383;&#383;ible to do &#383;o here. The hou&#383;es are neither
furni&#383;hed nor put together for the climate, and we are fanned
by the&#383;e congealing winds, a&#383; though the apertures which
admit them were de&#383;igned to alleviate the ardours of an
Italian &#383;un.</p>
<p>The &#383;atin hangings of my room, framed on canvas, wave with
the gale&#383; lodged behind them every &#383;econd. A pair of
"&#383;ilver cupids, nicely poi&#383;ed on their brands,"
&#383;upport a wood fire, which it is an occupation to keep from
extingui&#383;hing; and all the illu&#383;ion of a gay orange-grove
pourtrayed on the tape&#383;try at my feet, is di&#383;&#383;ipated
by a villainous cha&#383;m of about half an inch between the floor
and the &#383;kirting-boards. Then we have &#383;o many
corre&#383;ponding windows, &#383;upernumerary doors, "and
pa&#383;&#383;ages that lead to nothing," that all our Engli&#383;h
ingenuity in comfortable arrangement i&#383; baffled.&mdash;When
the cold fir&#383;t became &#383;o in&#383;upportable, we attempted
to live entirely in the eating-room, which is warmed by a poele, or
German &#383;tove, but the kind of heat it emits is &#383;o
depre&#383;&#383;ive and relaxing to tho&#383;e who are not inured
to it, that we are again returned to our large chimney and
wood-fire.&mdash;The French depend more on the warmth of their
clothing, than the comfort of their hou&#383;es. They are all
wadded and furred as though they were going on a &#383;ledge party,
and the men, in thi&#383; re&#383;pect, are more delicate than the
ladies: but whether it be the con&#383;equence of the&#383;e
precautions, or from any other cau&#383;e, I ob&#383;erve they are,
in general, without excepting even the natives of the Southern
provinces, le&#383;s &#383;en&#383;ible of cold than the
Engli&#383;h.</p>

<h2>Amiens, Jan. 30, 1795.</h2>
<p>Delacroix, author of <i>"Les Con&#383;titutions Politiques de
l'Europe,"</i> [The Political Con&#383;titutions of Europe.] has
lately publi&#383;hed a work much read, and which has excited the
di&#383;plea&#383;ure of the A&#383;&#383;embly &#383;o highly,
that the writer, by way of preliminary critici&#383;m, has been
arre&#383;ted. The book is intitled <i>"Le Spectateur Francais
pendant la Revolution."</i> [The French Spectator during the
Revolution.] It contains many truths, and &#383;ome
&#383;peculations very unfavourable both to republicani&#383;m and
it&#383; founders. It ventures to doubt the free acceptance of the
democratic con&#383;titution, propo&#383;es indirectly the
re&#383;toration of the monarchy, and dilates with great
compo&#383;ure on a plan for tran&#383;porting to America all the
Deputies who voted for the King's death. The popularity of the
work, &#383;till more than its principles, has contributed to
exa&#383;perate the A&#383;&#383;embly; and &#383;erious
apprehen&#383;ions are entertained for the fate of Delacroix, who
is ordered for trial to the Revolutionary Tribunal.</p>
<p>It would a&#383;toni&#383;h a &#383;uperficial ob&#383;erver to
&#383;ee with what avidity all forbidden doctrines are read. Under
the Church and Monarchy, a dei&#383;tical or republican author
might &#383;ometimes acquire pro&#383;elytes, or become the
favourite amu&#383;ement of fa&#383;hionable or literary people;
but the circulation of &#383;uch works could be only partial, and
among&#383;t a particular cla&#383;s of readers: whereas the
trea&#383;on of the day, which compri&#383;e&#383; whatever favours
Kings or religion, is under&#383;tood by the meane&#383;t
individual, and the temptation to the&#383;e prohibited enjoyments
is a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted both by affection and
prejudice.&mdash;An almanack, with a plea&#383;antry on the
Convention, or a couplet in behalf of royali&#383;m, is handed
my&#383;teriou&#383;ly through half a town, and a <i>brochure</i>
[A pamphlet.] of higher preten&#383;ions, though on the &#383;ame
principles, is the very bonne bouche of our political
<i>gourmand&#383;</i>. [Gluttons.]</p>
<p>There is, in fact, no liberty of the pre&#383;s. It is permitted
to write again&#383;t Barrere or the Jacobins, becau&#383;e they
are no longer in power; but a &#383;ingle word of
di&#383;re&#383;pect towards the Convention is more certain of
being followed by a Lettre de Cachet, than a volume of &#383;atire
on any of Louis the Fourteenth's mini&#383;ters would have been
formerly. The only period in which a real freedom of the pre&#383;s
has exi&#383;ted in France were tho&#383;e years of the late King's
reign immediately preceding the revolution; and either through the
contempt, &#383;upinene&#383;s, or wor&#383;e motives, of
tho&#383;e who &#383;hould have checked it, it exi&#383;ted in too
great a degree: &#383;o that dei&#383;ts and republicans were
permitted to corrupt the people, and undermine the government
without re&#383;traint.*</p>

the wreck of that of an un&#383;u&#383;pecting and unfortunate
Monarch.</blockquote>

<p>After the fourteenth of July 1789, political literature became
more &#383;ubject to mobs and the lanterne, than ever it had been
to Mini&#383;ters and Ba&#383;tilles; and at the tenth of
Augu&#383;t 1792, every ve&#383;tige of the liberty of the
pre&#383;s di&#383;appeared.*&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>* "What impartial man among us mu&#383;t not be forced
to acknowledge, that &#383;ince the revolution it has become
dangerous for any one, I will not &#383;ay to attack the

government has adopted." Di&#383;cours de Jean Bon St. Andre
&#383;ur la Liberte de la Pre&#383;&#383;e, 30th April, 1795. A law
was pa&#383;&#383;ed on the fir&#383;t of May, 1795, a &#383;hort
time after thi&#383; letter was written, making it
tran&#383;portation to vilify the National Repre&#383;entation,
either by words or writing; and if the offence were committed
publicly, or among a certain number of people, it became
capital.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Under the Bri&#383;&#383;otins it was fatal to write, and
hazardous to read, any work which tended to exculpate the King, or
to cen&#383;ure his de&#383;poti&#383;m, and the
ma&#383;&#383;acres that accompanied and followed it.*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I appeal for the confirmation of this to every
per&#383;on who re&#383;ided in France at that period.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;During the time of Robe&#383;pierre the &#383;ame
&#383;y&#383;tem was only tran&#383;mitted to other hands, and
would &#383;till prevail under the Moderates, if their tyranny were
not circum&#383;cribed by their weakne&#383;s. It was &#383;ome
time before I ventured to receive Freron's Orateur du Peuple by the
po&#383;t. Even pamphlets written with the greate&#383;t caution
are not to be procured without difficulty in the country; and this
is not to be wondered at when we recollect how many people have
lo&#383;t their lives through a &#383;ub&#383;cription to a
new&#383;paper, or the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of &#383;ome
work, which, when they purcha&#383;ed it, was not interdicted.</p>
<p>As the government has lately a&#383;&#383;umed a more civilized
ca&#383;t, it wa&#383; expected that the anniver&#383;ary of the
King's death would not have been celebrated. The Convention,
however, determined otherwi&#383;e; and their mu&#383;ical band was
ordered to attend as u&#383;ual on occa&#383;ions of
fe&#383;tivity. The leader of the band had perhaps &#383;en&#383;e
and decency enough to &#383;uppo&#383;e, that if &#383;uch an event
could po&#383;&#383;ibly be ju&#383;tified, it never could be a
&#383;ubject of rejoicing, and therefore made choice of melodies
rather tender than gay. But this Lydian mood, far from having the
mollifying effect attributed to it by Scriblerus, threw
&#383;everal Deputies into a rage; and the conductor was
reprimanded for daring to in&#383;ult the ears of the
legi&#383;lature with &#383;trains which &#383;eemed to lament the
tyrant. The affrighted mu&#383;ician begged to be heard in his
defence; and declaring he only meant, by the adoption of the&#383;e
gentle airs, to expre&#383;s the tranquillity and happine&#383;s
enjoyed under the republican con&#383;titution, &#383;truck off Ca
Ira.</p>
<p>When the ceremony was over, one Brival propo&#383;ed, that the
young King &#383;hould be put to death; ob&#383;erving that
in&#383;tead of the many u&#383;ele&#383;s crime&#383; which had
been committed, this ought to have had the preference. The motion
was not &#383;econded; but the Convention, in order to defeat the
purpo&#383;es of the royali&#383;ts, who, they &#383;ay,
increa&#383;e in number, have ordered the Committees to
con&#383;ider of &#383;ome way of &#383;ending this poor child out
of the country.</p>
<p>When I reflect on the event which the&#383;e men have &#383;o
indecently commemorated, and the horrors which &#383;ucceeded it, I
feel &#383;omething more than a dete&#383;tation for
republicani&#383;m. The undefined notions of liberty imbibed from
poets and hi&#383;torians, fade away&mdash;my reverence for names
long con&#383;ecrated in our annals abate&#383;&mdash;and the
&#383;ole object of my political attachment is the Engli&#383;h
con&#383;titution, as tried by time and undeformed by the
experiments of vi&#383;ionaries and impo&#383;tors. I begin to
doubt either the &#383;en&#383;e or hone&#383;ty of mo&#383;t of
tho&#383;e men who are celebrated as the promoters of changes of
government which have chiefly been adopted rather with a view to
indulge a favourite theory, than to relieve a people from any
acknowledged oppre&#383;&#383;ion. A wi&#383;e or good man would
di&#383;tru&#383;t hi&#383; judgment on a &#383;ubject &#383;o
momentous, and perhaps the be&#383;t of &#383;uch reformers were
but enthu&#383;ia&#383;ts. Shafte&#383;bury calls
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m an hone&#383;t pa&#383;&#383;ion; yet we have
&#383;een it is a very dangerous one: and we may perhap&#383;
learn, from the example of France, not to venerate principles which
we do not admire in practice.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* I do not imply that the French Revolution was the
work of enthu&#383;ia&#383;ts, but that the enthu&#383;ia&#383;m of
Rou&#383;&#383;eau produced a horde of Bri&#383;&#383;ots, Marats,
Robe&#383;pierres, &amp;c. who &#383;peculated on the affectation
of it. The Abbe Sieyes, who&#383;e views were directed to a change
of Monarchs, not a di&#383;&#383;olution of the monarchy, and who
in promoting a revolution did not mean to found a republic,
ha&#383; ventured to doubt both the political genius of
Rou&#383;&#383;eau, and the hone&#383;ty of his &#383;ectaries.

dimini&#383;hed by con&#383;iderations to which the
philo&#383;opher of the day would allow no influence; yet by their
a&#383;&#383;imilation with the Deputies and Generals who&#383;e
names are &#383;o ob&#383;cure as to e&#383;cape the memory, they
cea&#383;e to in&#383;pire that mixed &#383;entiment which is the
re&#383;ult of national pride and per&#383;onal affection. The name
of a General or an Admiral &#383;erves as the epitome of an
hi&#383;torical relation, and &#383;uffices to recall all his
glories, and all his &#383;ervices; but this &#383;ort of
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m is entirely repelled by an account that the
citizens Gillet and Jourbert, two repre&#383;entatives heard of
almo&#383;t for the fir&#383;t time, have taken
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of Am&#383;terdam.</p>
<p>I enquired of a man who was &#383;awing wood for us this
morning, what the bells clattered for la&#383;t night. <i>"L'on m'a
dit</i> (an&#383;wered he) <i>que c'e&#383;t pour quelque ville que
quelque general de la republique a pri&#383;e. Ah! ca nous avancera
beaucoup; la paix et du pain, je crois, &#383;era mieux notre

&#383;ome town or other, that &#383;ome general or other has

peace and bread, I think, would an&#383;wer our purpo&#383;e better
than all the&#383;e victories."] I told him he ought to &#383;peak
with more caution. <i>"Mourir pour mourir,</i> [One death's as good
as another.] (&#383;ay&#383; he, half gaily,) one may as well die
by the Guillotine as be &#383;tarved. My family have had no bread
the&#383;e two days, and becau&#383;e I went to a neighbouring
village to buy a little corn, the pea&#383;ants, who are
jealou&#383; that the town's people already get too much of the

<p>&mdash;It is true, the wants of the lower cla&#383;&#383;es are

&#383;ay nominal, for it has repeatedly happened, that none has
been di&#383;tributed for three days together, and the quantity

learn, from a letter of Florent-Guyot's to the A&#383;&#383;embly,

be&#383;ides the &#383;ervice of the common cau&#383;e, views of
their own, and are often enabled by the&#383;e fictions to
admini&#383;ter both to their intere&#383;t and their vanity. They
ingratiate them&#383;elves with the ari&#383;tocrats, who are

<h2>Beauvais, March 13, 1795.</h2>
<p>I have often, in the cour&#383;e of the&#383;e letters,
experienced how difficult it is to de&#383;cribe the political
&#383;ituation of a country governed by no fixed principles, and
&#383;ubject to all the fluctuations which are produced by the
intere&#383;ts and pa&#383;&#383;ions of individuals and of
parties. In &#383;uch a &#383;tate conclu&#383;ions are
nece&#383;&#383;arily drawn from daily events, minute facts, and an
attentive ob&#383;ervation of the opinions and
di&#383;po&#383;itions of the people, which, though they leave a
perfect impre&#383;&#383;ion on the mind of the writer, are not
ea&#383;ily conveyed to that of the reader. They are like colours,
the various &#383;hades of which, though di&#383;criminated by the
eye, cannot be de&#383;cribed but in general terms.</p>
<p>Since I la&#383;t wrote, the government has con&#383;iderably
improved in decency and moderation; and though the French enjoy as
little freedom as their almo&#383;t &#383;ole Allies, the
Algerines, yet their terror begins to wear off&mdash; and,
temporizing with a de&#383;poti&#383;m they want energy to
de&#383;troy, they rejoice in the &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;ion of
oppre&#383;&#383;ions which a day or an hour may renew. No one
pretends to have any faith in the Convention; but we are tranquil,
if not &#383;ecure&mdash;and, though &#383;ubject to a
thou&#383;and arbitrary details, incompatible with a good
government, the political &#383;y&#383;tem i&#383; doubtle&#383;s
meliorated. Ju&#383;tice and the voice of the people have been
attended to in the arre&#383;t of Collot, Barrere, and Billaud,
though many are of opinion that their puni&#383;hment will extend
no farther; for a trial, particularly that of Barrere, who is in
the &#383;ecret of all factions, would expo&#383;e &#383;o many
revolutionary my&#383;teries and patriotic reputations, that there
are few members of the Convention who will not wi&#383;h it evaded;
they probably expect, that the &#383;eclu&#383;ion, for &#383;ome
months, of the per&#383;ons of the delinquents will appea&#383;e
the public vengeance, and that this affair may be forgotten in the
bu&#383;tle of more recent events.&mdash;If there had been any
doubt of the crimes of the&#383;e men, the publication of
Robe&#383;pierre'&#383; papers would have removed them; and,
exclu&#383;ive of their value when con&#383;idered as a
hi&#383;tory of the times, the&#383;e papers form one of the
mo&#383;t curious and humiliating monuments of human
deba&#383;ement, and human depravity, extant.*</p>

<p>After &#383;everal &#383;kirmi&#383;hes between the Jacobins and
Mu&#383;cadins, the bu&#383;t of Marat has been expelled from the
theatres and public places of Paris, and the Convention have
ratified this popular judgment, by removing him al&#383;o from
their Hall and the Pantheon. But reflecting on the frailty of our
nature, and the levity of their countrymen, in order to obviate the
di&#383;orders the&#383;e premature beatifications give ri&#383;e
to, they have decreed that no patriot &#383;hall in future by
Pantheonized until ten years after hi&#383; death. This is no long
period; yet revolutionary reputations have hitherto &#383;carcely
&#383;urvived as many months, and the puerile enthu&#383;ia&#383;m
which is adopted, not felt, has been u&#383;ually &#383;ucceeded by
a violence and revenge equally irrational.</p>
<p>It has lately been di&#383;covered that Condorcet is dead, and
that he peri&#383;hed in a manner &#383;ingularly awful. Travelling
under a mean appearance, he &#383;topped at a public hou&#383;e to
refre&#383;h him&#383;elf, and wa&#383; arre&#383;ted in
con&#383;equence of having no pa&#383;&#383;port. He told the
people who examined him he was a &#383;ervant, but a Horace, which
they found about him, leading to a &#383;u&#383;picion that he was
of a &#383;uperior rank, they determined to take him to the next
town. Though already exhau&#383;ted, he was obliged to walk
&#383;ome miles farther, and, on his arrival, he was depo&#383;ited
in a pri&#383;on, where he was forgotten, and &#383;tarved to
death.</p>
<p>Thus, perhaps at the moment the French were apotheo&#383;ing an
ob&#383;cure demagogue, the celebrated Condorcet expired, through
the neglect of a gaoler; and now, the coar&#383;e and ferocious
Marat, and the more refined, yet more pernicious, philo&#383;opher,
are both involved in one common obloquy.</p>
<p>What a theme for the morali&#383;t!&mdash;Perhaps the gaoler,
who&#383;e brutal carele&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s terminated the days
of Condorcet, extingui&#383;hed his own humanity in the torrent of
that revolution of which Condorcet him&#383;elf wa&#383; one of the
authors; and perhaps the death of a &#383;overeign, whom Condorcet
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted in bringing to the &#383;caffold, might
have been this man's fir&#383;t le&#383;&#383;on in cruelty, and
have taught him to &#383;et little value on the live&#383; of the
re&#383;t of mankind.&mdash;The French, though they do not
analy&#383;e &#383;eriou&#383;ly, &#383;peak of this event as a
ju&#383;t retribution, which will be followed by others of a
&#383;imilar nature. <i>"Quelle mort,"</i> ["What an end."]
&#383;ays one&mdash;<i>"Elle e&#383;t affreu&#383;e,</i> (&#383;ays
another,) <i>mais il etoit cau&#383;e que bien d'autres ont peri
au&#383;&#383;i."</i>&mdash;<i>"Ils periront tous, et tant
mieux,"</i> ["'Twas dreadful&mdash;but how many people have
peri&#383;hed by his means."&mdash; "They'll all &#383;hare the
&#383;ame fate, and &#383;o much the better."] reply twenty voices;
and this is the only epitaph on Condorcet.</p>
<p>The pretended revolution of the thirty-fir&#383;t of May, 1792,
which ha&#383; occa&#383;ioned &#383;o much blood&#383;hed, and
which I remember it dangerous not to hallow, though you did not
under&#383;tand why, is now formally era&#383;ed from among the
fe&#383;tivals of the republic; but this is only the triumph of
party, and a &#383;ignal that the remains of the
Bri&#383;&#383;otines are gaining ground.</p>
<p>A more con&#383;picuous and a more popular victory has been
obtained by the royali&#383;ts, in the trial and acquittal of
Delacroix. The jury had been changed after the affair of Carrier,
and were now better compo&#383;ed; though the e&#383;cape of
Delacroix is more properly to be attributed to the intimidating
favour of the people. The verdict was received with
&#383;hout&#383; of applau&#383;e, repeated with tran&#383;port,
and Delacroix, who had &#383;o patriotically projected to purify
the Convention, by &#383;ending more than half its members to
America, was borne home on the &#383;houlders of an exulting
populace.</p>
<p>Again the extinction of the war in La Vendee is officially
announced; and it is certain that the chiefs are now in treaty with
government. Such a peace only implies, that the country is
exhau&#383;ted, for it &#383;uffices to have read the treatment of
the&#383;e unhappy people to know that a reconciliation can neither
be &#383;incere nor permanent. But whatever may be the eventual
effect of this negotiation, it has been, for the pre&#383;ent, the
means of wre&#383;ting &#383;ome unwilling conce&#383;&#383;ions
from the A&#383;&#383;embly in favour of a free exerci&#383;e of
religion. No arrangement could ever be propo&#383;ed to the
Vendeans, which did not include a toleration of Chri&#383;tianity;
and to refu&#383;e that to patriots and republicans, which wa&#383;
granted to rebels and royali&#383;ts, was deemed at this time
neither rea&#383;onable nor politic. A decree is therefore
pa&#383;&#383;ed, authorizing people, if they can overcome all the
annexed ob&#383;tacles, to wor&#383;hip God in they way they have
been accu&#383;tomed to.</p>
<p>The public hitherto, far from being a&#383;&#383;ured or
encouraged by this decree, appear to have become more timid and
&#383;u&#383;picious; for it is conceived in &#383;o narrow and
paltry a &#383;pirit, and expre&#383;&#383;ed in &#383;uch
malignant and illu&#383;ive terms, that it can hardly be &#383;aid
to intend an indulgence. Of twelve articles of an act &#383;aid to
be conce&#383;&#383;ive, eight are prohibitory and
re&#383;trictive; and a municipal officer, or any other per&#383;on
"in place or office," may controul at his plea&#383;ure all
religious celebrations. The cathedrals and pari&#383;h churches yet
&#383;tanding were &#383;eized on by the government at the
introduction of the Godde&#383;&#383;es of Rea&#383;on, and the
decree expre&#383;&#383;ly declares that they &#383;hall not be
re&#383;tored or appropriated to their original u&#383;es.
Individuals, who have purcha&#383;ed chapels or churches,
he&#383;itate to &#383;ell or let them, le&#383;t they &#383;hould,
on a change of politics, be per&#383;ecuted as the abettors of
fanatici&#383;m; &#383;o that the long-de&#383;ired
re&#383;toration of the Catholic wor&#383;hip makes but very
&#383;low progre&#383;s.*&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This decree prohibits any pari&#383;h, community, or
body of people collectively, from hiring or purcha&#383;ing a
church, or maintaining a clergyman: it al&#383;o forbids ringing a
bell, or giving any other public notice of Divine Service, or even
di&#383;tingui&#383;hing any building by external &#383;igns of its
being dedicated to religion.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;A few people, who&#383;e zeal overpowers their
di&#383;cretion, have ventured to have ma&#383;&#383;es at their
own hou&#383;es, but they are thinly attended; and on a&#383;king
any one if they have yet been to this &#383;ort of conventicle, the
reply is, <i>"On new &#383;ait pas trop ce que le decret veut dire;
il faut voir comment cela tournera."</i> ["One cannot rightly
comprehend the decree&mdash;it will be be&#383;t to wait and
&#383;ee how things go."] Such a di&#383;tru&#383;t is indeed very
natural; for there are two &#383;ubjects on which an inveterate
hatred i&#383; apparent, and which are equally obnoxious to all
&#383;y&#383;tems and all partie&#383; in the
A&#383;&#383;embly&mdash;I mean Chri&#383;tianity and Great
Britain. Every day produces harangues again&#383;t the latter; and
Boi&#383;&#383;y d'Anglas has &#383;olemnly proclaimed, as the
directing principle of the government, that the only negociation
for peace &#383;hall be a new boundary de&#383;cribed by the
Northern conque&#383;ts of the republic; and this mode&#383;t
diplomatic is &#383;upported by arguments to prove, that the
commerce of England cannot be ruined on any other terms.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* "How (exclaims the &#383;agacious Bourdon de
l'Oi&#383;e) can you hope to ruin England, if you do not keep

<p>The debates of the Convention increa&#383;e in variety and
amu&#383;ement. Be&#383;ide&#383; the manual exerci&#383;es of the
members, the accu&#383;ations and retorts of unguarded choler,
di&#383;clo&#383;e to us many curious truths which a politic
unanimity might conceal. Saladin, who was a &#383;tipendiary of the
Duke of Orleans, and who&#383;e reputation would not grace any
other a&#383;&#383;embly, i&#383; tran&#383;formed into a Moderate,
and talks of virtue and crime; while Andre Dumont, to the great
admiration of his private biographi&#383;ts, has been &#383;igning
a peace with the Duke of Tu&#383;cany.&mdash;Our republican
&#383;tate&#383;men require to be viewed in per&#383;pective: they
appear to no advantage in the foreground. Dumont would have made "a
good pantler, he would have chipp'd bread well;" or, like Scrub, he
might have "drawn warrants, or drawn beer,"&mdash;but I &#383;hould
doubt if, in a tran&#383;action of this nature, the Dukedom of
Tu&#383;cany was ever before &#383;o a&#383;&#383;orted; and if the
Duke were obliged to make this peace, he may well &#383;ay,
"nece&#383;&#383;ity doth make us herd with &#383;trange
companions."</p>
<p>Notwith&#383;tanding the Convention &#383;till dete&#383;ts
Chri&#383;tianity, utter&#383; anathemas again&#383;t England, and
exhibits daily &#383;cenes of indecent di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion
and reviling, it is doubtle&#383;s become more moderate on the
whole; and though this moderation be not equal to the people's
wi&#383;hes, it is more than &#383;ufficient to exa&#383;perate the
Jacobins, who call the Convention the Senate of Coblentz, and are
perpetually endeavouring to excite commotions. The belief is,
indeed, general, that the A&#383;&#383;embly contains a &#383;trong
party of royali&#383;ts; yet, though this may be true in a degree,
I fear the impul&#383;e which has been given by the public opinion,
i&#383; mi&#383;taken for a tendency in the Convention it&#383;elf.
But however, this may be, neither the imputations of the Jacobins,
nor the hopes of the people, have been able to oppo&#383;e the
progre&#383;s of a &#383;entiment which, operating on a character
like that of the French, is more fatal to a popular body than even
hatred or contempt. The long duration of this
di&#383;a&#383;trou&#383; legi&#383;lature has excited an
univer&#383;al wearine&#383;s; the guilt of particular members is
now le&#383;s di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed than the in&#383;ignificance
of the whole a&#383;&#383;emblage; and the epithets corrupt, worn
out, hackneyed, and everla&#383;ting, [Tare, u&#383;e, banal, and
eternel.] have almo&#383;t &#383;uper&#383;eded tho&#383;e of
rogues and villains.</p>
<p>The law of the maximum has been repealed &#383;ome time, and we
now procure nece&#383;&#383;aries with much greater facility; but
the a&#383;&#383;ignats, no longer &#383;upported by violence, are
rapidly dimini&#383;hing in credit&mdash;&#383;o that every thing
is dear in proportion. We, who are more than indemnified by the
ri&#383;e of exchange in our favour, are not affected by the&#383;e
progre&#383;&#383;ive augmentations in the price of
provi&#383;ions. It would, however, be erroneous and unfeeling to
judge of the &#383;ituation of the French them&#383;elves from
&#383;uch a calculation.</p>
<p>People who have let their e&#383;tates on lea&#383;es, or have
annuities on the Hotel de Ville, &amp;c. receive
a&#383;&#383;ignats at par, and the wages of the labouring poor are
&#383;till comparatively low. What was five years ago a
hand&#383;ome fortune, now barely &#383;upplies a decent
maintenance; and &#383;maller incomes, which were competencies at
that period, are now almo&#383;t in&#383;ufficient for
exi&#383;tence. A workman, who formerly earned twenty-five
&#383;ols a day, has at pre&#383;ent three livres; and you give a
&#383;emp&#383;tre&#383;s thirty &#383;ols, in&#383;tead of ten:
yet meat, which was only five or &#383;ix &#383;ols when wages was
twenty-five, is now from fifty &#383;ols to three livres the pound,
and every other article in the &#383;ame or a higher proportion.
Thus, a man's daily wages, in&#383;tead of purcha&#383;ing four or
five pounds of meat, a&#383; they would have done before the
revolution, now only purcha&#383;e one.</p>
<p>It grieves me to &#383;ee people whom I have known at their
ea&#383;e, obliged to relinqui&#383;h, in the decline of life,
comforts to which they were accu&#383;tomed at a time when youth
rendered indulgence le&#383;s nece&#383;&#383;ary; yet every day
points to the nece&#383;&#383;ity of additional oeconomy, and
&#383;ome little convenience or enjoyment is retrenched&mdash;and

creatures of habit, a di&#383;h of coffee, or a gla&#383;s of
liqueur, &amp;c. will not &#383;eem &#383;uch trifling privations.

<p>If the wants of one cla&#383;s were relieved by the&#383;e
deductions from the enjoyments of another, it might form a

comfort&#383; of mediocrity, deprive the poor of bread and raiment,
and enforced par&#383;imony is not more generally con&#383;picuous
than wretchedne&#383;s.</p>
<p>The frugal tables of tho&#383;e who were once rich, have been
accompanied by relative and &#383;imilar changes among the lower
cla&#383;&#383;es; and the &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion of gilt
equipages is &#383;o far from dimini&#383;hing the number of wooden
&#383;hoes, that for one pair of &#383;abots which were &#383;een
formerly, there are now ten. The only Lucullu&#383;'s of the day
are a &#383;warm of adventurers who have e&#383;caped from
pri&#383;ons, or abandoned gaming-hou&#383;es, to rai&#383;e
fortunes by &#383;peculating in the various modes of acquiring
wealth which the revolution has engendered.&mdash;The&#383;e,
together with the numberle&#383;s agents of government enriched by
more direct pillage, live in coar&#383;e luxury, and
di&#383;&#383;ipate with carele&#383;s profu&#383;ion tho&#383;e
riches which their original &#383;ituations and habits have
di&#383;qualified them from converting to a better u&#383;e.</p>
<p>Although the circum&#383;tances of the times have
nece&#383;&#383;itated a good deal of dome&#383;tic oeconomy among
people who live on their fortunes, they have lately
a&#383;&#383;umed a gayer &#383;tyle of dre&#383;s, and are
le&#383;s aver&#383;e from frequenting public amu&#383;ements. For
three years pa&#383;t, (and very naturally,) the gentry have openly
murmured at the revolution; and they now, either convinced of the
impolicy of &#383;uch conduct, terrified by their pa&#383;t
&#383;ufferings, or, above all, de&#383;irous of proclaiming their
triumph over the Jacobins, are every where reviving the national
ta&#383;te for mode&#383; and finery. The attempt to reconcile
the&#383;e gaieties with prudence, ha&#383; introduced &#383;ome
contra&#383;ts in apparel whim&#383;ical enough, though our French
belles adopt them with much gravity.</p>
<p>In con&#383;equence of the di&#383;orders in the South of
France, and the interruption of commerce by &#383;ea, &#383;oap is
not only dear, but &#383;ometime&#383; difficult to purcha&#383;e
at any rate. We have our&#383;elves paid equal to five livres a
pound in money. Hence we have white wig&#383;* and grey
&#383;tockings, medallions and gold chains with coloured
handkerchiefs and di&#383;coloured tuckers, and chemi&#383;es de
Sappho, which are often worn till they rather remind one of the
pious Queen I&#383;abel, than the Greek poete&#383;s.</p>

<blockquote>* Vilate, in his pamphlet on the &#383;ecret
cau&#383;es of the revolution of the ninth Thermidor, relates the
following anecdote of the origin of the peruques blondes. "The
caprice of a revolutionary female who, on the fete in celebration
of the Supreme Being, covered her own dark hair with a tete of a
lighter colour, having excited the jealou&#383;y of La Demahe, one
of Barrere's mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es, &#383;he took occa&#383;ion
to complain to him of this coquettry, by which &#383;he thought her
own charms eclip&#383;ed. Barrere in&#383;tantly &#383;ent for
Payen, the national agent, and informed him that a new
counter-revolutionary &#383;ect had &#383;tarted up, and that its
partizans di&#383;tingui&#383;hed them&#383;elve&#383; by wearing
wigs made of light hair cut from the heads of the guillotined
ari&#383;tocrats. He therefore enjoined Payen to make a &#383;peech
at the municipality, and to thunder again&#383;t this new mode. The
mandate was, of cour&#383;e, obeyed; and the women of rank, who had
never before heard of the&#383;e wigs, were both &#383;urprized and
alarmed at an imputation &#383;o dangerous. Barrere is &#383;aid to
have been highly amu&#383;ed at having thus &#383;olemnly
&#383;topped the progre&#383;s of a fa&#383;hion, only becua&#383;e
it di&#383;plea&#383;ed one of his female favourites.&mdash;I
perfectly remember Payen's oration again&#383;t this coeffure, and
every woman in Paris who had light hair, was, I doubt not,
intimidated." This plea&#383;antry of Barrere's proves with what
inhuman levity the government &#383;ported with the feelings of the
people. At the fall of Robe&#383;pierre, the peruque blonde, no
longer &#383;ubject to the empire of Barrere's favourites, became a
reigning mode.</blockquote>

<p>This is a large manufacturing town, and the capital of the
department of l'Oi&#383;e. Its manufactories now owe their chief
activity to the requi&#383;itions for &#383;upplying cloth to the
armies. Such commerce is by no means courted; and if people were
permitted, as they are in mo&#383;t countries, to trade or let it
alone, it would &#383;oon decline.&mdash;The choir of the cathedral
is extremely beautiful, and has luckily e&#383;caped republican
deva&#383;tation, though there &#383;eems to exi&#383;t no hope
that it will be again re&#383;tored to the u&#383;e of public
wor&#383;hip. Your books will inform you, that Beauvais was

thou&#383;and men, and that he failed in the attempt. Its modern
hi&#383;tory i&#383; not &#383;o fortunate. It was for &#383;ome
time hara&#383;&#383;ed by a revolutionary army, who&#383;e
exactions and di&#383;orders being oppo&#383;ed by the inhabitants,
a decree of the Convention declared the town in a &#383;tate of
rebellion; and thi&#383; ban, which operates like the Papal
excommunications three centuries ago, and authorizes tyranny of all
kinds, was not removed until long after the death of
Robe&#383;pierre.&mdash;Such a &#383;pecimen of republican
government has made the people cautious, and abundant in the
exteriors of patrioti&#383;m. Where they are &#383;ure of their
company, they expre&#383;s them&#383;elves without re&#383;erve,
both on the &#383;ubject of their legi&#383;lators and the

had done wrong, I replaced the print without farther explanation:
but they both called this evening, and reproached me
&#383;eparately for thus expo&#383;ing their &#383;entiments to

may partly explain the great aenigma why no effectual

<h2>Amiens, April 12, 1795.</h2>
<br />
<p>In&#383;tead of commenting on the late di&#383;orders at Paris,
I &#383;ubjoin the tran&#383;lation of a letter ju&#383;t received
by Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; from a friend, who&#383;e
information, we have rea&#383;on to believe, is as exact as can
po&#383;&#383;ibly be obtained in the chaos of little intrigues
which now compri&#383;e the whole &#383;cience of French
politics.</p>
<p>"Paris, April 9.</p>
<p>"Though I know, my good friend, you are &#383;ufficiently
ver&#383;ed in the technicals of our revolution not to form an
opinion of occurrences from the language in which they are
officially de&#383;cribed, yet I cannot re&#383;i&#383;t the
favourable opportunity of Mad. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
return, to communicate &#383;uch explanations of the late events as
their very ambiguous appearance may render nece&#383;&#383;ary even
to you.</p>
<p>"I mu&#383;t begin by informing you, that the propo&#383;ed
decree of the Convention to di&#383;&#383;olve them&#383;elves and
call a new A&#383;&#383;embly, was a mere coquettry.
Hara&#383;&#383;ed by the &#383;truggles of the Jacobins, and
alarmed at the &#383;ymptoms of public wearine&#383;s and
di&#383;gu&#383;t, which became every day more vi&#383;ible, they
hoped this feint might operate on the fears of the people of Paris,
and animate them to a more decided &#383;upport again&#383;t the
effort&#383; of the common enemy, as well as tend to reconcile them
to a farther endurance of a repre&#383;entation from which they did
not di&#383;gui&#383;e their wi&#383;hes to be relea&#383;ed. An
opportunity was therefore &#383;eized on, or created, when our
allowance of bread had become unu&#383;ually &#383;hort, and the
Jacobins unu&#383;ually turbulent, to bring forward this project of
renovating the legi&#383;lature. But in politics, as well as love,
&#383;uch experiments are dangerous. Far from being received with
regret, the propo&#383;ition excited univer&#383;al tran&#383;port;
and it required all the diligence of the agents of government to
in&#383;inuate effectually, that if Paris were abandoned by the
Convention at this juncture, it would not only become a prey to
famine, but the Jacobins would avail them&#383;elves of the
momentary di&#383;order to regain their power, and renew their
pa&#383;t atrocities.</p>
<p>"A conviction that we in reality derive our &#383;canty
&#383;upplies from exertions which would not be made, were they not
nece&#383;&#383;ary to re&#383;train the popular ill humour, added
to an habitual apprehen&#383;ion of the Clubs,*
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted this manoeuvre; and a few of the
&#383;ections were, in con&#383;equence, prevailed on to
addre&#383;s our Repre&#383;entatives, and to reque&#383;t they
would remain at their po&#383;t.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>* Paris had been long almo&#383;t entirely dependent on
the government for &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, &#383;o that an
in&#383;urrection could always be procured by withholding the
u&#383;ual &#383;upply. The departments were pillaged by
requi&#383;itions, and enormous &#383;ums &#383;ent to the neutral
countries to purcha&#383;e provi&#383;ions, that the capital might
be maintained in dependence and good humour. The provi&#383;ions
obtained by the&#383;e mean&#383; were di&#383;tributed to the
&#383;hopkeepers, who had in&#383;tructions to retail them to the
idle and di&#383;orderly, at about a twentieth part of the original
co&#383;t, and no one could profit by this regulation, without
fir&#383;t receiving a ticket from the Committee of his
&#383;ection. It was lately a&#383;&#383;erted in the Convention,
and not di&#383;avowed, that if the government per&#383;i&#383;ted
in this &#383;ort of traffic, the annual lo&#383;&#383; attending
the article of corn alone would amount to fifty million&#383;
&#383;terling. The reduction of the &#383;um in que&#383;tion into
Engli&#383;h money is made on a pre&#383;umption that the French
government did not mean (were it to be avoided) to commit an act of
bankruptcy, and redeem their paper at le&#383;s than par.
Reckoning, however, at the real value of a&#383;&#383;ignats when
the calculation was made, and they were then worth perhaps a fifth
of their nominal value, the government was actually at the expence
of ten millions &#383;terling a year, for &#383;upplying Pari&#383;
with a very &#383;canty portion of bread! The &#383;um mu&#383;t
appear enormous, but the peculation under &#383;uch a government
mu&#383;t be incalculable; and when it is recollected that all
neutral &#383;hips bringing cargoes for the republic mu&#383;t have
been in&#383;ured at an immen&#383;e premium, or perhaps eventually
purcha&#383;ed by the French, and that very few could reach their
de&#383;tination, we may conclude that &#383;uch as did arrive
co&#383;t an immoderate &#383;um.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;"The in&#383;urrection that immediately &#383;ucceeded
was at fir&#383;t the effect of a &#383;imilar &#383;cheme, and it
ended in a party contention, in which the people, as u&#383;ual,
were neuter.</p>
<p>"The examination into the conduct of Barrere, Collot, &amp;c.
had been delayed until it &#383;eemed rather a mea&#383;ure
de&#383;tined to protect than to bring them to puni&#383;hment; and
the impatience which was every where expre&#383;&#383;ed on the
&#383;ubject, &#383;ufficiently indicated the nece&#383;&#383;ity,
or at lea&#383;t the prudence, of ha&#383;tening their trial. Such
a proce&#383;s could not be ventured on but at the ri&#383;k of
involving the whole Convention in a labyrinth of crimes,
incon&#383;i&#383;tencies, and ridicule, and the delinquent&#383;
already began to exonerate them&#383;elves by appealing to the vote
of &#383;olemn approbation pa&#383;&#383;ed in their favour three
months after the death of Robe&#383;pierre had re&#383;tored the
A&#383;&#383;embly to entire freedom.</p>
<p>"The only means of extrication from this dilemma, appeared to be
that of finding &#383;ome pretext to &#383;ati&#383;fy the public
vengeance, without hazarding the &#383;candal of a judicial
expo&#383;ure. Such a pretext it was not difficult to give
ri&#383;e to: a dimini&#383;hed portion of bread never fails to
produce tumultuous a&#383;&#383;emblages, that are ea&#383;ily
directed, though not ea&#383;ily &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed; and
crouds of this de&#383;cription, agitated by real mi&#383;ery, were
excited (as we have every rea&#383;on to &#383;uppo&#383;e) by
hired emi&#383;&#383;aries to a&#383;&#383;ail the Convention with
di&#383;orderly clamours for bread. This being attributed to the
friends of the culprits, decrees were opportunely introduced and
pa&#383;&#383;ed for tran&#383;porting them untried out of the
republic, and for arre&#383;ting mo&#383;t of the principal Jacobin
members as their partizans.</p>
<p>"The &#383;ub&#383;equent di&#383;turbances were le&#383;s
artificial; for the Jacobins, thu&#383; rendered de&#383;perate,
attempted re&#383;i&#383;tance; but, as they were
un&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful, their efforts only &#383;erved their
adver&#383;aries as an excu&#383;e for arre&#383;ting &#383;everal
of the party who had e&#383;caped the former decrees.</p>
<p>"Nothing, I a&#383;&#383;ure you, can with le&#383;s truth be
denominated popular movements, than many of the&#383;e &#383;cenes,
which have, notwith&#383;tanding, powerfully influenced the fate of
our country. A revolt, or in&#383;urrection, is often only an
affair of intrigue and arrangement; and the de&#383;ultory
violences of the &#383;uburbs of St. Antoine, or of the market
women, are regulated by the &#383;ame Committee and cabals that
direct our campaigns and treaties. The common
di&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es of the people are continually drawing
them together; and, when thus collected, their credulity renders
them the ready in&#383;truments of any prevailing faction.</p>
<p>"Our recent di&#383;orders afforded a &#383;triking proof of
this. I was my&#383;elf the Cicerone of a country friend on the day
the Convention was fir&#383;t a&#383;&#383;ailed. The numbers who
crouded into the hall were at fir&#383;t con&#383;iderable, yet
they exhibited no &#383;igns of ho&#383;tility, and it wa&#383;
evident they were brought there for &#383;ome purpo&#383;e of which
they were them&#383;elves ignorant. When a&#383;ked their
intentions, they vociferated 'Du pain! Du pain!'&mdash;Bread,
Bread; and, after occupying the &#383;eats of the Deputies for a
&#383;hort time, quietly withdrew.</p>
<p>"That this in&#383;urrection was originally factitious, and
devi&#383;ed for the purpo&#383;e I have mentioned, is farther
corroborated by the &#383;udden appearance of Pichegru and other
officers, who &#383;eemed brought expre&#383;&#383;ly to protect
the departure of the obnoxious trio, in ca&#383;e it &#383;hould be
oppo&#383;ed either by their friends or enemies. It is
likewi&#383;e to be remarked, that Barrere and the re&#383;t were
&#383;topped at the gates of Paris by the &#383;ame mob who were
alledged to have ri&#383;en in their favour, and who, in&#383;tead
of endeavouring to re&#383;cue them, brought them back to the
Committee of General Safety, on a &#383;uppo&#383;ition that they
had e&#383;caped from pri&#383;on.&mdash;The members of the
moderate party, who were detained in &#383;ome of the
&#383;ections, &#383;u&#383;tained no ill treatment whatever, and
were relea&#383;ed on being claimed by their colleagues, which
could &#383;carcely have happened, had the mob been under the
direction of the Jacobins, or excited by them.&mdash;In &#383;hort,
the whole bu&#383;ine&#383;s proved that the populace were mere
agents, guided by no impul&#383;e of their own, except hunger, and
who, when left to them&#383;elves, rather impeded than promoted the
de&#383;igns of both factions.</p>
<p>"You mu&#383;t have been &#383;urprized to &#383;ee among the
li&#383;t of members arre&#383;ted, the name of Laurent Lecointre;
but he could never be pardoned for having reduced the Convention to

<p>The propo&#383;ed di&#383;&#383;olution of the
A&#383;&#383;embly alluded to in the beginning of Mons.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s letter, occa&#383;ioned here a more
general rejoicing than even the fall of the Jacobin club, and, not
being influenced by the motives &#383;ugge&#383;ted to the
Pari&#383;ians, we were &#383;incerely di&#383;appointed when we
found the mea&#383;ure po&#383;tponed. The morning this news
arrived, we walked about the town till dinner, and in every
&#383;treet people were collected in groupes, and engaged in eager
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ion. An acquaintance whom we happened to
meet, in&#383;tead of the u&#383;ual &#383;alutations, exclaimed
"<i>Nou&#383; viola quittes, ils &#383;'en vont les
brigand&#383;</i>" ["At length we are quit of them&mdash;the rogues
are going about their bu&#383;ine&#383;s."]; and I ob&#383;erved
&#383;everal recontres of this &#383;ort, where people &#383;kipped
and caracoled, as though unable to contain their
&#383;ati&#383;faction. Nothing was talked of but <i>Le Petit</i>
[An endearing appellation given to the young King by tho&#383;e who
would not venture to mention his name.], and the new elections; and
I remarked with plea&#383;ure, that every one agreed in the total
exclu&#383;ion of all the pre&#383;ent Deputies.</p>
<p>Two mornings after we had been indulging in the&#383;e agreeable
vi&#383;ions, we learned that the Convention, purely from a
patriotic de&#383;ire of &#383;erving their country, had determined
not to quit their po&#383;t. We were at thi&#383; time in extreme
want of bread, the di&#383;tribution not exceeding a quarter of a
pound per day; and numbers who are at their ea&#383;e in other
re&#383;pects, could not obtain any. This, operating perhaps with
the latent ill humour occa&#383;ioned by &#383;o unwelcome a
declaration of per&#383;everance on the part of their
Repre&#383;entatives, occa&#383;ioned a violent ferment among the
people, and on the &#383;econd of this month they were in open
revolt; the magazine of corn for the u&#383;e of the army was
be&#383;ieged, the national colours were in&#383;ulted, and Blaux,
a Deputy who is here on mi&#383;&#383;ion, was dragged from the
Hotel de Ville, and obliged by the enraged populace to cry "Vive le
Roi!" The&#383;e di&#383;orders continued till the next day, but
were at length appea&#383;ed by a &#383;mall di&#383;tribution of
flour from the magazine.</p>
<p>In the debates of the Convention the whole is a&#383;cribed to
the Jacobins, though it is well known they have no influence here;
and I wi&#383;h you to attend to this circum&#383;tance more
particularly, as it proves what artifices are u&#383;ed to conceal
the real &#383;entiments of the people. I, and every inhabitant of
Amiens, can atte&#383;t that this revolt, which wa&#383; declared
in the A&#383;&#383;embly to have been in&#383;tigated by the
partizans of the Jacobins, was, as far as it had any decided
political character, an efferve&#383;cence of royali&#383;m.</p>
<p>At Rouen, Abbeville, and other places, the trees of liberty,
(or, rather, the trees of the republic,) have been cut down, the
tri-coloured flag torn, and the cry of "Vive le Roi!" was for
&#383;ome time predominant; yet the &#383;ame
mi&#383;repre&#383;entation was had recour&#383;e to, and all
the&#383;e places were a&#383;&#383;erted to have
e&#383;pou&#383;ed the cau&#383;e of that party to which they are
mo&#383;t repugnant.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that the chief &#383;ource of the&#383;e
u&#383;ele&#383;s exce&#383;&#383;es is famine, and that it is for
the mo&#383;t part the lower cla&#383;&#383;es only who promote
them; but the &#383;ame cau&#383;e and the &#383;ame
de&#383;cription of people were made the in&#383;truments for
bringing about the revolution, and the poor &#383;eek now, a&#383;
they did in 1789, a remedy for their accumulated &#383;ufferings in
a change of government. The ma&#383;s of mankind are ever more
readily deluded by hope than benefited by experience; and the
French, being taught by the revolutioni&#383;ts to look for that
relief from changes of government which &#383;uch changes cannot
afford, now expect that the re&#383;toration of the monarchy will
produce plenty, as they were before per&#383;uaded that the
fir&#383;t efforts to &#383;ubvert it would bani&#383;h want.</p>
<p>We are now tolerably quiet, and &#383;hould &#383;eriou&#383;ly
think of going to Paris, were we not apprehen&#383;ive that
&#383;ome attempt from the Jacobins to re&#383;cue their chiefs,
may create new di&#383;turbances. The late affair appears to have
been only a retaliation of the thirty-fir&#383;t of May, 1792; and
the remains of the Girondi&#383;ts have now pro&#383;cribed the
leaders of the Mountaineers, much in the &#383;ame way as they were
then pro&#383;cribed them&#383;elves.&mdash;Yours.</p>

<h2>Amiens, May 9, 1795.</h2>
<p>Whil&#383;t all Europe is probably watching with &#383;olicitude
the progre&#383;s of the French arms, and the variations of their
government, the French them&#383;elves, almo&#383;t indifferent to
war and politics, think only of averting the horrors of famine. The
important news of the day is the portion of bread which is to be
di&#383;tributed; and the &#383;iege of Mentz, or the treaty with
the King of Pru&#383;&#383;ia, are almo&#383;t forgotten,
amid&#383;t enquiries about the arrival of corn, and anxiety for
the approach of harve&#383;t. The &#383;ame paper that announces
the &#383;urrender of towns, and the &#383;ucce&#383;s of battles,
tells us that the poor die in the &#383;treets of Paris, or are
driven to commit &#383;uicide, through want. We have no longer to
contend with avaricious &#383;peculations, but a real
&#383;carcity; and detachments of the National Guard, reinforced by
cannon, often &#383;earch the adjacent villages &#383;everal days
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively without finding a &#383;ingle
&#383;eptier of corn. The farmers who have yet been able to conceal
any, refu&#383;e to di&#383;po&#383;e of it for
a&#383;&#383;ignats; and the poor, who have neither plate nor
money, exchange their be&#383;t clothes or linen for a loaf, or a
&#383;mall quantity of flour. Our gates are &#383;ometimes
a&#383;&#383;ailed by twenty or thirty people, not to beg money,
but bread; and I am frequently acco&#383;ted in the &#383;treet by
women of decent appearance, who, when I offer them
a&#383;&#383;ignats, refu&#383;e them, &#383;aying, "We have enough
of this &#383;orry paper&mdash;it is bread we want."&mdash;If you
are a&#383;ked to dine, you take your bread with you; and you
travel as though you were going a voyage&mdash;for there are not
many inns on the road where you can expect to find bread, or indeed
provi&#383;ions of any kind.</p>
<p>Having procured a few &#383;ix-livre pieces, we were enabled to
purcha&#383;e a &#383;mall &#383;upply of corn, though by no means
enough for our con&#383;umption, &#383;o that we are obliged to
oeconomi&#383;e very rigidly. Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and
the &#383;ervants eat bread made with three-parts bran to one of
flour. The little provi&#383;ion we po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s is,
however, a great embarra&#383;&#383;ment to us, for we are not only
&#383;ubject to domiciliary vi&#383;its, but continually liable to
be pillaged by the &#383;tarving poor around us; and we are often
under the nece&#383;&#383;ity of pa&#383;&#383;ing &#383;everal
meals without bread, becau&#383;e we dare not &#383;end the wheat
to be ground, nor bake except at night. While the la&#383;t
operation is performing, the doors are carefully &#383;hut, the
bell rings in vain, and no gue&#383;t is admitted till every
ve&#383;tige of it is removed.&mdash;All the breweries have
&#383;eals put upon the doors, and &#383;evere penal laws are
i&#383;&#383;ued again&#383;t converting barley to any other
purpo&#383;e than the making of bread. If what is allowed us were
compo&#383;ed only of barley, or any other whole&#383;ome grain, we
&#383;hould not repine; but the di&#383;tribution at pre&#383;ent
i&#383; a mixture of grown wheat, peas, rye, &amp;c. which has
&#383;carcely the re&#383;emblance of bread.</p>
<p>I was a&#383;ked to-day, by &#383;ome women who had ju&#383;t
received their portion, and in an accent of rage and de&#383;pair
that alarmed me, whether I thought &#383;uch food fit for a human
creature.&mdash;We cannot alleviate this mi&#383;ery, and are
impatient to e&#383;cape from the &#383;ight of it. If we can
obtain pa&#383;&#383;port&#383; to go from hence to Paris, we hope
there to get a final relea&#383;e, and a permi&#383;&#383;ion to
return to England.</p>
<p>My friend Madame de la F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has left
us, and I fear is only gone home to die. Her health was perfectly
good when we were fir&#383;t arre&#383;ted, though vexation, more
than confinement, has contributed to undermine it. The revolution
had, in various ways, dimini&#383;hed her property; but thi&#383;
&#383;he would have endured with patience, had not the law of
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ion&#383; involved her in difficulties which
appeared every day more interminable, and perplexed her mind by the
pro&#383;pect of a life of litigation and uncertainty. By this law,
all inheritances, donations, or beque&#383;ts, &#383;ince the
fourteenth of July 1789, are annulled and &#383;ubjected to a
general partition among the neare&#383;t relatives. In
con&#383;equence, a large e&#383;tate of the Marqui&#383;e's, as
well as another already &#383;old, are to be accounted for, and
divided between a variety of claimants. Two of the number being
emigrants, the republic is al&#383;o to &#383;hare; and as the live
&#383;tock, furniture, farming uten&#383;ils, and arrears, are
included in thi&#383; ab&#383;urd and iniquitous regulation, the
confu&#383;ion and embarra&#383;&#383;ment which it has
occa&#383;ioned are inde&#383;cribable.</p>
<p>Though an unlucky combination of circum&#383;tances has rendered
&#383;uch a law particularly oppre&#383;&#383;ive to Madame de la
F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, &#383;he is only one of an infinite
number who are affected by it, and many of whom may perhaps be
&#383;till greater &#383;ufferers than her&#383;elf. The
Con&#383;tituent A&#383;&#383;embly had attempted to form a code
that might counteract the &#383;pirit of legal di&#383;putation,
for which the French are &#383;o remarkable; but this &#383;ingle
decree will give birth to more proce&#383;&#383;es than all the
<i>pandects, canons,</i> and <i>droits feodaux,</i> accumulated
&#383;ince the days of Charlemagne; and I doubt, though one half
the nation were lawyers, whether they might not find
&#383;ufficient employment in demalgamating the property of the
other half.</p>
<p>This mode of partition, in it&#383;elf ill calculated for a rich
and commercial people, and better adapted to the republic of St.
Marino than to that of France, was introduced under pretext of
favouring the &#383;y&#383;tem of equality; and its tran&#383;ition
from ab&#383;urdity to inju&#383;tice, by giving it a retroactive
effect, was promoted to accommodate the "virtuou&#383;" Herault de
Sechelles, who acquired a con&#383;iderable addition of fortune by
it. The Convention are daily be&#383;et with petitions from all
parts on this &#383;ubject; but their followers and them&#383;elves
being &#383;omewhat in the &#383;tyle of Fal&#383;taff's
regiment&mdash;"younger &#383;ons of younger brothers," they
&#383;eem determined, as they u&#383;ually are, to &#383;quare
their notions of ju&#383;tice by what is mo&#383;t conducive to
their own intere&#383;t.</p>
<p>An apprehen&#383;ion of &#383;ome attempt from the Jacobins, and
the di&#383;content&#383; which the &#383;carcity of bread give
ri&#383;e to among the people, have produced a private order from
the Committees of government for arming and re-organizing the
National Guard.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Though I have often had occa&#383;ion to u&#383;e the
term National Guard, it is to be under&#383;tood only as citizens
armed for &#383;ome temporary purpo&#383;e, who&#383;e arms were
taken from them as &#383;oon as that &#383;ervice wa&#383;
performed. The <i>Garde Nationale,</i> as a regular
in&#383;titution, had been in a great mea&#383;ure
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed &#383;ince the &#383;ummer of 1793, and
tho&#383;e who compo&#383;ed it gradually di&#383;armed. The
u&#383;ual &#383;ervice of mounting guard was &#383;till continued,
but the citizens, with very few exceptions, were armed only with
pikes, and even tho&#383;e were not entru&#383;ted to their own
care, each delivering up his arms when he retired more exactly than
if it were an article of capitulation with a
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful enemy.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;I remember, in 1789 and 1790, when this popular militia
was fir&#383;t in&#383;tituted, every one, either from policy or
inclination, appeared eager to promote it; and nothing was
di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed but military fetes, balls, exerci&#383;e,
and uniforms. The&#383;e patriotic levities have now entirely
vani&#383;hed, and the bu&#383;ine&#383;s proceeds with languor and
difficulty. One dreads the pre&#383;ent expence, another future
per&#383;ecution, and all are &#383;olicitous to find cau&#383;e
for exemption.</p>
<p>This reluctance, though perhaps to be regretted, is in a great
mea&#383;ure ju&#383;tifiable. Where the lives and fortunes of a
whole nation are dependent on the changes of party, ob&#383;curity
becomes the &#383;ure&#383;t protection, and tho&#383;e who are
zealous now, may be the fir&#383;t &#383;acrifice&#383; hereafter.
Nor is it encouraging to arm for the defence of the Convention,
which is de&#383;pi&#383;ed, or to oppo&#383;e the violence of a
populace, who, however mi&#383;guided, are more objects of
compa&#383;&#383;ion than of puni&#383;hment.</p>
<p>Fouquier Tinville, with &#383;ixteen revolutionary Judges and
Jurymen, have been tried and executed, at the moment when the
in&#383;tigators of their crimes, Billaud-Varennes, Collot, &amp;c.
were &#383;entenced by the Convention to a bani&#383;hment, which
is probably the object of their wi&#383;hes. Thi&#383; Tinville and
his accomplices, who condemned thou&#383;ands with &#383;uch
ferociou&#383; gaiety, beheld the approach of death them&#383;elves
with a mixture of rage and terror, that even cowardice and guilt do
not always exhibit. It &#383;eems an awful di&#383;pen&#383;ation
of Providence, that they who were inhuman enough to wi&#383;h to
deprive their victims of the courage which enabled them to
&#383;ubmit to their fate with re&#383;ignation, &#383;hould in
their la&#383;t moment&#383; want that courage, and die
de&#383;pairing, furious, and uttering imprecations, which were
returned by the enraged multitude.*</p>
<p>&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Some of the Jurymen were in the habit of taking
caricatures of the pri&#383;oners while they condemned them. Among
the papers of the Revolutionary Tribunal were found blank
&#383;entences, which were occa&#383;ionally &#383;ent to the
Committee of Public Safety, to be filled up with the names of
tho&#383;e intended to be &#383;acrificed.&mdash;The name of one of
the Jurymen executed on this occa&#383;ion was Leroi, but being a
very ardent republican, he had changed it for that of Citizen Tenth
of Augu&#383;t.</blockquote>

<h2>Amiens, May 26, 1795.</h2>
<p>Our journey to Paris has been po&#383;tponed by the
in&#383;urrection which occurred on the fir&#383;t and &#383;econd
of Prairial, (20th and 21&#383;t of May,) and which was not like
that of Germinal, fabricated&mdash;but a real and violent attempt
of the Jacobins to regain their power. Of this event it is to be
remarked, that the people of Paris were at fir&#383;t merely
&#383;pectators, and that the Convention were at length defended by
the very cla&#383;&#383;es which they have &#383;o long
oppre&#383;&#383;ed under the denomination of ari&#383;tocrats. For
&#383;everal hours the A&#383;&#383;embly was &#383;urrounded, and
in the power of it&#383; enemies; the head of Ferraud, a deputy,
was borne in triumph to the hall;* and but for the impolitic
precipitation of the Jacobins, the pre&#383;ent government might
have been de&#383;troyed.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The head of Ferraud was placed on a pole, and, after
being paraded about the Hall, &#383;tationed oppo&#383;ite the
Pre&#383;ident. It is impo&#383;&#383;ible to execrate
&#383;ufficiently this &#383;avage triumph; but &#383;imilar
&#383;cenes had been applauded on the fourteenth of July and the
fifth and &#383;ixth of October 1789; and the Pari&#383;ians had
learned, from the example of the Convention them&#383;elves, that
to rejoice in the daily &#383;acrifice of fifty or &#383;ixty
people, was an act of patrioti&#383;m. As to the epithet&#383; of
Coquin, Scelerats, Voleurs, &amp;c. which were now be&#383;towed on
the A&#383;&#383;embly, they were only what the members were in the
con&#383;tant habit of applying to each other. The
a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;in of Ferraud being afterwards taken and
&#383;entenced to the Guillotine, was re&#383;cued by the mob at
the place of execution, and the inhabitants of the Fauxbourg St.
Antoine were in revolt for two days on this occa&#383;ion, nor
would they give him up until abandoned by the cannoneers of their
party.&mdash;It is &#383;ingular, and does no honour to the
revolutionary &#383;chool, or the people of Paris, that Madame
Elizabeth, Mal&#383;herbes, Cecile Renaud, and thou&#383;ands of
others, &#383;hould peri&#383;h innocently, and that the only
effort of this kind &#383;hould be exerted in favour of a murderer
who de&#383;erved even a wor&#383;e death.</blockquote>

<p>The conte&#383;t began, as u&#383;ual, by an

the national palace, and loudly clamoured for immediate
&#383;upplies of bread. They then proceeded to reproach the
Convention with having robbed them of their liberty, plundered the
public trea&#383;ure, and finally reduced the country to a

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;It was not ea&#383;y either to produce bread, or refute
the&#383;e charges, and the Deputies of the moderate party remained
&#383;ilent and overpowered, while the Jacobins encouraged the mob,
and began to head them openly. The Pari&#383;ians, however
intere&#383;ted in the re&#383;ult of this &#383;truggle, appeared
to behold it with indifference, or at lea&#383;t with inactivity.
Ferraud had already been ma&#383;&#383;acred in endeavouring to
repel the croud, and the Convention was abandoned to outrage and
in&#383;ult; yet no effectual attempt had been made in their
defence, until the Deputies of the Mountain prematurely avowed
their de&#383;igns, and moved for a repeal of all the doctrines
&#383;ince the death of Robe&#383;pierre&mdash;for the
reincarceration of &#383;u&#383;pected per&#383;on&#383;&mdash;and,
in fine, for an ab&#383;olute revival of the whole revolutionary
&#383;y&#383;tem.</p>
<p>The avowal of the&#383;e projects created an immediate alarm
among tho&#383;e on whom the ma&#383;&#383;acre of Ferraud, and the
dangers to which the A&#383;&#383;embly wa&#383; expo&#383;ed, had
made no impre&#383;&#383;ion. The di&#383;may became general; and
in a few hours the ari&#383;tocrats them&#383;elves collected
together a force &#383;ufficient to liberate the
A&#383;&#383;embly,* and wre&#383;t the government from the hands
of the Jacobins.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This is &#383;tated as a ground of reproach by the
Jacobins, and i&#383; admitted by the Convention. Andre Dumont, who
had taken &#383;o active a part in &#383;upporting
Robe&#383;pierre's government, was yet on thi&#383; occa&#383;ion
defended and protected the whole day by a young man who&#383;e
father had been guillotined.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;This defeat ended in the arre&#383;t of all who had taken
a part again&#383;t the now triumphant majority; and there are, I
believe, near fifty of them in cu&#383;tody, be&#383;ides numbers
who contrived to e&#383;cape.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Among tho&#383;e implicated in this attempt to revive
the revolutionary government was Carnot, and the decree of
arre&#383;t would have been carried again&#383;t him, had it not
been &#383;ugge&#383;ted that his talents were nece&#383;&#383;ary
in the military department. All that remained of Robe&#383;pierre's
Committees, Jean Bon St. Andre, Robert Lindet, and Prieur, were
arre&#383;ted. Carnot alone was excepted; and it was not
di&#383;gui&#383;ed that his utility, more than any
&#383;uppo&#383;ed integrity, procured him the
exemption.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>That the efforts of this more &#383;anguinary faction have been
checked, i&#383; doubtle&#383;s a temporary advantage; yet
tho&#383;e who calculate beyond the moment &#383;ee only the
perpetuation of anarchy, in a habit of expelling one part of the
legi&#383;lature to &#383;ecure the government of the other; nor
can it be denied, that the freedom of the repre&#383;entative body
has been as much violated by the Moderates in the recent
tran&#383;actions, as by the Jacobin&#383; on the thirty-fir&#383;t
of May 1793. The Deputies of the Mountain have been pro&#383;cribed
and impri&#383;oned, rather as partizans than criminals; and it
i&#383; the opinion of many, that the&#383;e mea&#383;ures, which
deprive the Convention of &#383;uch a portion of its members,
attach as much illegality to the proceedings of the re&#383;t, as
the former violences of Robe&#383;pierre and hi&#383; faction.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The decrees pa&#383;&#383;ed by the Jacobin members
during their few hour&#383; triumph cannot be defended; but the
whole Convention had long acquie&#383;ced in them, and the
preci&#383;e time when they were to cea&#383;e wa&#383; certainly a
matter of opinion. The greater part of the&#383;e member&#383; were
accu&#383;ed of no active violence, nor could they have been
arre&#383;ted on any principles but that of being rivals to a
faction &#383;tronger than them&#383;elves.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;It is true, the reigning party may plead in their
ju&#383;tification that they only inflict what they would
them&#383;elves have &#383;uffered, had the Jacobins prevailed; and
this is an additional proof of the weakne&#383;s and
in&#383;tability of a form of government which is incapable of
re&#383;i&#383;ting oppo&#383;ition, and which knows no medium
between yielding to it&#383; adver&#383;aries, and de&#383;troying
them.</p>
<p>In a well organized con&#383;titution, it is &#383;uppo&#383;ed
that a liberal &#383;pirit of party is &#383;alutary. Here they
di&#383;pute the alternatives of power and emolument, or
pri&#383;ons and guillotines; and the &#383;ole re&#383;ult to the
people is the certainty of being &#383;acrificed to the fears, and
plundered by the rapacity of either faction which may chance to
acquire the &#383;uperiority.&mdash; Had the government any
permanent or inherent &#383;trength, a party watching its errors,
and eager to attack them, might, in time, by the&#383;e perpetual
colli&#383;ions, give birth to &#383;ome principles of liberty and
order. But, a&#383; I have often had occa&#383;ion to notice, this
&#383;pecies of republicani&#383;m is in it&#383;elf &#383;o weak,
that it cannot exi&#383;t except by a con&#383;tant recurrence to
the very de&#383;poti&#383;m it profe&#383;&#383;es to exclude.
Hence it is jealous and &#383;u&#383;picious, and all
oppo&#383;ition to it is fatal; &#383;o that, to u&#383;e an
argument &#383;omewhat &#383;imilar to Hume's on the liberty of the
pre&#383;s in republics, the French po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s a
&#383;ort of freedom which does not admit of enjoyment; and, in
order to boa&#383;t that they have a popular con&#383;titution, are
obliged to &#383;upport every kind of tyranny.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Hume ob&#383;erves, that ab&#383;olute monarchies and
republics nearly approach; for the exce&#383;s of liberty in the
latter renders &#383;uch re&#383;traints nece&#383;&#383;ary as to
make them in practice re&#383;emble the former.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The provinces take much le&#383;s intere&#383;t in this event,
than in one of a more general and per&#383;onal effect, though not
apparently of equal importance. A very few weeks ago, the
Convention a&#383;&#383;everated, in the u&#383;ual acclamatory
&#383;tyle, that they would never even li&#383;ten to a
propo&#383;al for dimini&#383;hing the value, or &#383;topping the
currency, of any de&#383;cription of a&#383;&#383;ignats. Their
oaths are not, indeed, in great repute, yet many people were
&#383;o far deceived, as to imagine that at lea&#383;t the credit
of the paper would not be formally de&#383;troyed by tho&#383;e who
had forced it&#383; circulation. All of a &#383;udden, and without
any previous notice, a decree was i&#383;&#383;ued to
&#383;uppre&#383;s the cor&#383;ets, (or a&#383;&#383;ignats of
five livres,) bearing the King's image;* and as the&#383;e were
very numerous, and chiefly in the hands of the lower order of
people, the con&#383;ternation produced by this mea&#383;ure was
&#383;erious and unu&#383;ual.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The opinion that prevailed at this time that a
re&#383;toration of the monarchy was intended by the Convention,
had rendered every one &#383;olicitous to ama&#383;s
a&#383;&#383;ignats i&#383;&#383;ued during the late King's reign.
Royal a&#383;&#383;ignats of five livres were exchanged for
&#383;ix, &#383;even, and eight livres of the republican
paper.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;There cannot be a &#383;tronger proof of the tyranny of
the government, or of the national propen&#383;ity to
&#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion, than the circum&#383;tance of making it
penal to refu&#383;e one day, what, by the &#383;ame authority, is
rendered valuele&#383;s the next&mdash;and that
notwith&#383;tanding this, the remaining a&#383;&#383;ignats are
&#383;till received under all the probability of their experiencing
a &#383;imilar fate.</p>
<p>Paris now offers an interval of tranquillity which we mean to
avail our&#383;elves of, and &#383;hall, in a day or two, leave
this place with the hope of procuring pa&#383;&#383;ports for
England. The Convention affect great moderation and gratitude for
their late re&#383;cue; and the people, per&#383;uaded in general
that the victorious party are royali&#383;ts, wait with impatience
&#383;ome important change, and expect, if not an immediate
re&#383;toration of the monarchy, at lea&#383;t a free election of
new Repre&#383;entatives, which mu&#383;t infallibly lead to it.
With this hope, which is the fir&#383;t that has long
pre&#383;ented it&#383;elf to this hara&#383;&#383;ed country, I
&#383;hall probably bid it adieu; but a vi&#383;it to the
metropolis will be too intere&#383;ting for me to conclude
the&#383;e papers, without giving you the re&#383;ult of my

<h2>Paris, June 3, 1795.</h2>
<p>We arrived here early on Saturday, and as no &#383;tranger
coming to Paris, whether a native of France, or a foreigner, is
&#383;uffered to remain longer than three days without a particular
permi&#383;&#383;ion, our fir&#383;t care was to pre&#383;ent
our&#383;elves to the Committee of the &#383;ection where we lodge,
and, on giving proper &#383;ecurity for our good conduct, we have
had this permi&#383;&#383;ion extended to a Decade.</p>
<p>I approached Paris with a mixture of curio&#383;ity and
apprehen&#383;ion, a&#383; though I expected the &#383;cenes which
had pa&#383;&#383;ed in it, and the moral changes it had undergone,
would be every where vi&#383;ible; but the gloomy ideas produced by
a vi&#383;it to this metropolis, are rather the effect of mental
a&#383;&#383;ociation than external objects. Palaces and public
building&#383; &#383;till remain; but we recollect that they are
become the pri&#383;ons of mi&#383;fortune, or the rewards of
ba&#383;ene&#383;s. We &#383;ee the &#383;ame hotels, but their
owners are wandering over the world, or have expired on the
&#383;caffold. Public places are not le&#383;s numerous, nor
le&#383;s frequented; but, far from in&#383;piring gaiety, we
behold them with regret and di&#383;gu&#383;t, a&#383; proofs of
the national levity and want of feeling.</p>
<p>I could almo&#383;t wi&#383;h, for the credit of the French
character, to have found &#383;ome indications that the pa&#383;t
was not &#383;o &#383;oon con&#383;igned to oblivion. It is true,
the reign of Robe&#383;pierre and his &#383;anguinary tribunal are
execrated in &#383;tudied phra&#383;es; yet is it enough to adopt
humanity as a mode, to &#383;ing the <i>Revel du Peuple</i> in
preference to the <i>Mar&#383;eillois,</i> or to go to a theatre
with a well-powdered head, in&#383;tead of cropped locks a la
Jacobin? But the people forget, that while they permitted, and even
applauded, the pa&#383;t horrors, they were al&#383;o
acce&#383;&#383;ary to them, and if they rejoice at their
termination, their &#383;en&#383;ibility doe&#383; not extend to
compunction; they ca&#383;t their &#383;orrows away, and think it
&#383;ufficient to exhibit their reformation in dre&#383;&#383;ing
and dancing&mdash;</p>

<p>The practice of the government appears to depart every day more
widely from its profe&#383;&#383;ions; and the moderate harangues
of the tribune are often &#383;ucceeded by mea&#383;ures as
arbitrary as tho&#383;e which are &#383;aid to be
exploded.&mdash;Perhaps the Convention begin to perceive their
mi&#383;take in &#383;uppo&#383;ing that they can maintain a
government again&#383;t the inclination of the people, without the
aid of tyranny. They expected at the &#383;ame time that they
decried Robe&#383;pierre, to retain all the power he
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed. Hence, their a&#383;&#383;umed
principles and their conduct are generally at variance; and,
divided between de&#383;poti&#383;m and weakne&#383;s, they
arre&#383;t the printers of pamphlets and new&#383;papers one day,
and are obliged to liberate them the next.&mdash;They exclaim
publicly again&#383;t the &#383;y&#383;tem of terror, yet
&#383;ecretly court the a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of its
agents.&mdash;They affect to re&#383;pect the liberty of the
pre&#383;s, yet every new publication has to defend it&#383;elf
again&#383;t the whole force of the government, if it happen to
cen&#383;ure a &#383;ingle member of the reigning
party.&mdash;Thus, the <i>Memoirs of Dumouriez</i> had circulated
nearly through all Europe, yet it was not without much ri&#383;k,

they &#383;eized on manu&#383;cripts, and laid embargoes on the

<p>I know not if it be attributable to the&#383;e political
incon&#383;i&#383;tencies that the calm which has &#383;ucceeded
the late di&#383;orders is little more than external. The minds of
the people are uncommonly agitated, and every one
expre&#383;&#383;es either hope or apprehen&#383;ion of &#383;ome
impending event. The royali&#383;ts, amid&#383;t their
o&#383;ten&#383;ible per&#383;ecutions, are particularly elated;
and I have been told, that many con&#383;picuous
revolutioni&#383;ts already talk of emigration.</p>
<p>I am ju&#383;t returned from a day's ramble, during which I have
met with various &#383;ubjects of unplea&#383;ant meditation. About
dinner-time I called on an old Chevalier de St. Louis and his lady,
who live in the Fauxbourg St. Germain. When I knew them formerly,
they had a hand&#383;ome annuity on the Hotel de Ville, and were in
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of all the comforts
nece&#383;&#383;ary to their declining years. To-day the door was
opened by a girl of dirty appearance, the hou&#383;e looked
mi&#383;erable, the furniture worn, and I found the old couple over
a &#383;lender meal of &#383;oup maigre and eggs, without wine or
bread. Our revolutionary adventures, as is u&#383;ual on all
meetings of this kind, were &#383;oon communicated; and I learned,
that almo&#383;t before they knew what was pa&#383;&#383;ing around
them, Mon&#383;ieur du G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s forty
year&#383;' &#383;ervice, and his croix, had rendered him
&#383;u&#383;pected, and that he and hi&#383; wife were taken from
their beds at midnight and carried to pri&#383;on. Here they
con&#383;umed their &#383;tock of ready money, while a guard,
placed in their hou&#383;e, pillaged what was moveable, and
&#383;poiled what could not be pillaged. Soon after the ninth of
Thermidor they were relea&#383;ed, but they returned to bare walls,
and their annuity, being paid in a&#383;&#383;ignats, now
&#383;carcely affords them a
&#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence.&mdash;Mon&#383;ieur du
G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is near &#383;eventy, and Madame is
become helple&#383;s from a nervous complaint, the effect of fear
and confinement; and if this depreciation of the paper &#383;hould
continue, the&#383;e poor people may probably die of ab&#383;olute
want.</p>
<p>I dined with a relation of the Marqui&#383;e's, and in the
afternoon we called by appointment on a per&#383;on who is employed
by the Committee of National Domains, and who has long
promi&#383;ed my friend to facilitate the adju&#383;tment of
&#383;ome of the various claims which the government has on her
property. This man was originally a valet to the brother of the
Marqui&#383;e: at the revolution he &#383;et up a &#383;hop, became
a bankrupt, and a furious Jacobin, and, in the end, a member of a
Revolutionary Committee. In the la&#383;t capacity he found means
to enrich him&#383;elf, and intimidate his creditor&#383; &#383;o
as to obtain a di&#383;charge of his debts, without the trouble of
paying them.*</p>

13, 1794. I am my&#383;elf acquainted with an old lady, who was

<p>&mdash;Since the di&#383;&#383;olution of the Committees, he has
contrived to obtain the &#383;ituation I have mentioned, and now
occupies &#383;uperb apartments in an hotel, amply furni&#383;hed
with the proofs of his official dexterity, and the perqui&#383;ites
of patrioti&#383;m.</p>
<p>The humiliating vici&#383;&#383;itudes occa&#383;ioned by the
revolution induced Madame de la F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to
apply to this democratic <i>parvenu,</i> [Up&#383;tart.] who&#383;e
office at pre&#383;ent gives him the power, and who&#383;e former
obligations to her family (by whom he was brought up) &#383;he
hoped would add the di&#383;po&#383;ition, to &#383;erve
her.&mdash;The gratitude &#383;he expected has, however, ended only
in delays and di&#383;appointments, and the &#383;ole object of my
commi&#383;&#383;ion was to get &#383;ome papers which &#383;he had
entru&#383;ted to him out of his
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion.</p>
<p>When we enquired if the Citizen was at home, a &#383;ervant, not
in livery, informed us Mon&#383;ieur was dre&#383;&#383;ing, but
that if we would walk in, he would let Mon&#383;ieur know we were
there. We pa&#383;&#383;ed through a dining parlour, where we
&#383;aw the remains of a de&#383;&#383;ert, coffee, &amp;c. and
were a&#383;&#383;ailed by the odours of a plentiful repa&#383;t.
As we entered the &#383;aloon, we heard the &#383;ervant call at
the door of an adjoining parlour, <i>"Mon&#383;ieur, voici deux
Citoyennes et un Citoyen qui vous demandent."</i> ["Sir, here are
two female citizens and one male citizen enquiring for you."] When
Mon&#383;ieur appeared, he apologized with an air of
graciou&#383;ne&#383;s for the impo&#383;&#383;ibility he had been
under of getting my friend's affairs arranged&mdash;prote&#383;ted
he was <i>accable</i> [Oppre&#383;&#383;ed..]&mdash;that he had
&#383;carcely an in&#383;tant at his own
di&#383;po&#383;al&mdash;that <i>enfin</i> the
re&#383;pon&#383;ibility of people in office was &#383;o terrible,
and the fatigue &#383;o <i>a&#383;&#383;ommante,</i>
[Overpowering.] that nothing but the pure&#383;t
<i>civi&#383;m,</i> and a heart <i>penetre de l'amour de la
patrie,</i> [Penetrated with the love of his country.] could enable
him to per&#383;evere in the ta&#383;k impo&#383;ed on him. As for
the papers we required, he would endeavour to find them, though his
cabinet was really &#383;o filled with petitions and certificates
of all &#383;orts, <i>que des malheureux lui avoient
addre&#383;&#383;es,</i> [Addre&#383;&#383;ed to him by unfortunate
people.] that it would not be very ea&#383;y to find them at
pre&#383;ent; and, with this an&#383;wer, which we &#383;hould have
&#383;miled at from M. de Choi&#383;eul or Sartine, we were obliged
to be &#383;ati&#383;fied. We then talked of the news of the day,
and he lamented that the ari&#383;tocrats were &#383;till
re&#383;tle&#383;s and increa&#383;ing in number, and that
notwith&#383;tanding the efforts of the Convention to diffu&#383;e
a &#383;pirit of philo&#383;ophy, it was too evident there was yet
much fanatici&#383;m among the people.</p>
<p>As we ro&#383;e to depart, Madame entered, dre&#383;&#383;ed for
vi&#383;iting, and decorated with bracelets on her wri&#383;ts and
above her elbows, medallions on her wai&#383;ts and neck, and,
indeed, finery wherever it could po&#383;&#383;ibly be
be&#383;towed. We ob&#383;erved her primitive condition of a
waiting-woman &#383;till operated, and that far from affecting the
language of her hu&#383;band, &#383;he retained a great deference
for rank, and was &#383;olicitous to in&#383;inuate that &#383;he
was &#383;ecretly of a &#383;uperior way of thinking. As we left
the room together, &#383;he made advances to an acquaintance with
my companions (who were people of condition); and having
occa&#383;ion to &#383;peak to a per&#383;on at the door, as
&#383;he uttered the word <i>Citoyen</i> &#383;he looked at us with
an expre&#383;&#383;ion which &#383;he intended &#383;hould imply
the contempt and reluctance with which &#383;he made u&#383;e of
it.</p>
<p>I have in general remarked, that the republicans are either of
the &#383;pecies I have ju&#383;t been de&#383;cribing, waiters,
jockies, gamblers, bankrupts, and low &#383;cribblers, living in
great &#383;plendour, or men taken from laborious
profe&#383;&#383;ions, more &#383;incere in their principles, more
ignorant and brutal&mdash;and who di&#383;&#383;ipate what they
have gained in gro&#383;&#383; luxury, becau&#383;e they have been
told that elegance and delicacy are worthy only of Sybarites, and
that the Greeks and Romans de&#383;pi&#383;ed both. The&#383;e
patriots are not, however, &#383;o uninformed, nor &#383;o
di&#383;intere&#383;ted, as to &#383;uppo&#383;e they are to
&#383;erve their country without &#383;erving them&#383;elves; and
they perfectly under&#383;tand, that the rich are their legal
patrimony, and that it is enjoined them by their mi&#383;&#383;ion
to pillage royali&#383;ts and ari&#383;tocrats.*</p>

<h2>Paris, June 6, 1795.</h2>
<p>I had &#383;carcely concluded my la&#383;t, when I received
advice of the death of Madame de la F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;;
and though I have, almo&#383;t from the time we quitted the
Providence, thought &#383;he was declining, and that &#383;uch an
event was probable, it has, neverthele&#383;s, both &#383;hocked
and grieved me.</p>
<p>Exclu&#383;ively of her many good and engaging qualities, which
were rea&#383;onable objects of attachment, Madame de la
F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was endeared to me by tho&#383;e
habits of intimacy that often &#383;upply the want of merit, and
make us adhere to our early friend&#383;hips, even when not
&#383;anctioned by our maturer judgment. Madame de la
F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; never became entirely dive&#383;ted
of the effects of a convent education; but if &#383;he retained a
love of trifling amu&#383;ements, and a &#383;ort of infantine
gaiety, &#383;he likewi&#383;e continued pious, charitable, and
&#383;trictly attentive not only to the duties, but to the decorum,
e&#383;&#383;ential in the female character and merit&#383; of this
&#383;ort are, I believe, now more rare than tho&#383;e in which
&#383;he might be deemed deficient.</p>
<p>I was &#383;peaking of her this morning to a lady of our
acquaintance, who acquie&#383;ced in my friendly eulogiums, but
added, in a tone of &#383;uperiority, <i>"C'etoit pourtant une
petite femme bien minutieu&#383;e</i>&mdash;&#383;he always put me
out of patience with her birds and her flowers, her levees of poor
people, and her per&#383;evering indu&#383;try in frivolous
projects." My friend was, indeed, the mo&#383;t feminine creature
in the world, and this is a flippant literary lady, who talks in
raptures of the Greeks and Romans, calls Rou&#383;&#383;eau
familiarly Jean Jaques, fri&#383;ks through the whole circle of
&#383;cience at the Lyceum, and has an utter contempt both for
per&#383;onal neatne&#383;s and dome&#383;tic oeconomy. How would
Madame de Sevigne wonder, could &#383;he behold one of the&#383;e
modern belles e&#383;prits, with which her country, as well as
England, abounds? In our zeal for reforming the irregular
orthography and hou&#383;ewifely penman&#383;hip of the la&#383;t
century, we are all become readers, and authors, and critics. I do
not a&#383;&#383;ert, that the female mind is too much cultivated,
but that it is too generally &#383;o; and that we encourage a
ta&#383;te for attainments not always compatible with the duties
and occupations of dome&#383;tic life. No age has, I believe,
produced &#383;o many literary ladies as the pre&#383;ent;* yet I
cannot learn that we are at all improved in morals, or that
dome&#383;tic happine&#383;s is more univer&#383;al than when,
in&#383;tead of writing &#383;onnets to dew-drops or
dai&#383;ies,** we copied prayers and recipes, in &#383;pelling
&#383;imilar to that of Stowe or Holling&#383;hed.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Let me not be &#383;uppo&#383;ed to undervalue the
female authors of the pre&#383;ent day. There are &#383;ome who,
uniting great talents with per&#383;onal worth, are ju&#383;tly
entitled to our re&#383;pect and admiration. The authore&#383;s of
"Cecilia," or the Mi&#383;s Lees, cannot be confounded with the
proprietors of all the Ca&#383;tles, Fore&#383;ts, Groves, Woods,
Cottages, and Caverns, which are &#383;o alluring in the catalogue
of a circulating library. ** Mrs. Smith's beautiful Sonnets have
produced &#383;onnetteers for every object in nature, vi&#383;ible
or invi&#383;ible; and her elegant tran&#383;lations of Petrarch
have procured the Italian bard many an Engli&#383;h dre&#383;s that
he would have been a&#383;hamed to appear in.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;We &#383;eem indu&#383;trious to make every branch of
education a vehicle for in&#383;piring a premature ta&#383;te for
literary amu&#383;ements; and our old fa&#383;hioned moral adages
in writing-books are replaced by &#383;craps from "Elegant
Extracts," while print-work and embroidery repre&#383;ent
&#383;cenes from poems or novels. I allow, that the &#383;ubjects
formerly pourtrayed by the needle were not pictore&#383;que, yet,
the tendency con&#383;idered, young ladie&#383; might as well
employ their &#383;ilk or pencils in exhibiting Daniel in the
lion&#383;' den, or Jo&#383;eph and his brethren, as Sterne's
Maria, or Charlotte and Werter.</p>
<p>You will forgive this digre&#383;&#383;ion, which I have been
led into on hearing the character of Madame de la
F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; depreciated, becau&#383;e &#383;he
was only gentle and amiable, and did not read Plutarch, nor hold
literary a&#383;&#383;emblies. It is, in truth, a little amende I
owe her memory, for I may my&#383;elf have &#383;ometimes
e&#383;timated her too lightly, and concluded my own pur&#383;uits
more rational than hers, when po&#383;&#383;ibly they were only
different. Her death has left an impre&#383;&#383;ion on my mind,
which the turbulence of Paris is not calculated to &#383;oothe; but
the &#383;hort time we have to &#383;tay, and the number of people
I mu&#383;t &#383;ee, oblige me to conquer both my regret and my
indolence, and to pa&#383;s a great part of the day in running from
place to place.</p>
<p>I have been employed all this morning in executing &#383;ome
female commi&#383;&#383;ions, which, of cour&#383;e, led me to
milliners, mantua-makers, &amp;c. The&#383;e people now recommend
fa&#383;hions by &#383;aying one thing is invented by Tallien's
wife, and another by Merlin de Thionville, or &#383;ome other
Deputy's mi&#383;tre&#383;s; and the genius of the&#383;e elegantes
has contrived, by a mode of dre&#383;&#383;ing the hair which
lengthens the neck, and by robes with an inch of wai&#383;t, to
give their countrywomen an appearance not much unlike that of a Bar
Gander.</p>
<p>I &#383;aw ye&#383;terday a relation of Madame de la
F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who is in the army, and whom I
formerly mentioned as having met when we pa&#383;&#383;ed through
Dourlens. He was for &#383;ome months &#383;u&#383;pended, and in
confinement, but i&#383; now re&#383;tored to his rank, and ordered
on &#383;ervice. He a&#383;ked me if I ever intended to vi&#383;it
France again. I told him I had &#383;o little rea&#383;on to be
&#383;ati&#383;fied with my treatment, that I did not imagine I
&#383;hould.&mdash;"Yes, (returned he,) but if the republic
&#383;hould conquer Italy, and bring all its trea&#383;ures to
Paris, as has lately been &#383;ugge&#383;ted in the Convention, we
&#383;hall tempt you to return, in &#383;pite of
your&#383;elf."*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>*The project of pillaging Italy of its mo&#383;t
valuable works of art was &#383;ugge&#383;ted by the
philo&#383;ophic Abbe Gregoire, a con&#383;titutional Bi&#383;hop,
as early as September 1794, becau&#383;e, as he alledged, the chefs
d'ouvres of the Greek republic ought not to embelli&#383;h a
country of &#383;laves.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;I told him, I neither doubted their intending &#383;uch a
&#383;cheme, nor the po&#383;&#383;ibility of its
&#383;ucce&#383;s, though it was not altogether worthy of
philo&#383;ophers and republicans to wage war for Venu&#383;'s and
Appollos, and to &#383;acrifice the lives of one part of their
fellow-citizens, that the re&#383;t might be amu&#383;ed with
pictures and &#383;tatues.&mdash;"That's not our affair
(&#383;ay&#383; Mon&#383;ieur de &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;).
Soldiers do not rea&#383;on. And if the Convention &#383;hould have
a fancy to pillage the Emperor of China's palace, I &#383;ee no
remedy but to &#383;et &#383;ail with the fir&#383;t fair
wind,"&mdash;"I wi&#383;h, (&#383;aid hi&#383; &#383;i&#383;ter,
who was the only per&#383;on pre&#383;ent,) in&#383;tead of being
under &#383;uch orders, you had e&#383;caped from the
&#383;ervice." "Yes, (returned the General quickly,) and wander
about Europe like Dumouriez, &#383;u&#383;pected and
de&#383;pi&#383;ed by all parties." I ob&#383;erved, Dumouriez was
an adventurer, and that on many accounts it was nece&#383;&#383;ary
to guard again&#383;t him. He &#383;aid, he did not di&#383;pute
the nece&#383;&#383;ity or even the ju&#383;tice of the conduct
ob&#383;erved toward&#383; him, but that neverthele&#383;s I might
be a&#383;&#383;ured it had operated as an effectual check to
tho&#383;e who might, otherwi&#383;e, have been tempted to follow
Dumouriez's example; "And we have now (added he, in a tone between
gaiety and de&#383;pair,) no alternative but obedience or the
guillotine."&mdash;I have tran&#383;cribed the &#383;ub&#383;tance
of this conver&#383;ation, as it confirms what I have frequently
been told, that the fate of Dumouriez, however merited, is one
great cau&#383;e why no de&#383;ertion of importance has &#383;ince
taken place.</p>
<p>I was ju&#383;t now interrupted by a noi&#383;e and
&#383;houting near my window, and could plainly
di&#383;tingui&#383;h the words Scipio and Solon uttered in a tone
of taunt and reproach. Not immediately comprehending how Solon or
Scipio could be introduced in a fray at Paris, I di&#383;patched
Angelique to make enquiry; and at her return I learned that a croud
of boys were following a &#383;hoemaker of the neighbourhood, who,
while he was member of a revolutionary Committee, had cho&#383;en
to unite in his per&#383;on the glories of both Rome and Greece, of
the &#383;word and gown, and had taken unto him&#383;elf the name
of Scipio Solon. A decree of the Convention &#383;ome weeks
&#383;ince enjoined all &#383;uch heroes and &#383;ages to
re&#383;ume their original appellations, and forbade any
per&#383;on, however ardent his patrioti&#383;m, to
di&#383;tingui&#383;h him&#383;elf by the name of Brutus, Timoleon,
or any other but that which he derived from his Chri&#383;tian
parents. The people, it &#383;eems, are not &#383;o obedient to the
decree as tho&#383;e whom it more immediately concerns; and a&#383;
the above-mentioned Scipio Solon had been detected in various
larcenies, he is not allowed to quit his &#383;hop without being
reproached with hi&#383; thefts, and his Greek and Roman
appellations.</p>

<h2>Paris, June 8, 1795.</h2>
<p>Ye&#383;terday being Sunday, and to-day the Decade, we have had
two holiday&#383; &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively, though, &#383;ince
the people have been more at liberty to manife&#383;t their
opinions, they give a decided preference to the Chri&#383;tian
fe&#383;tival over that of the republic.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* This was only at Paris, where the people, from their
number, are le&#383;s manageable, and of cour&#383;e more
courageous. In the departments, the &#383;ame cautious timidity
prevailed, and appeared likely to continue.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;They ob&#383;erve the former from inclination, and the
latter from nece&#383;&#383;ity; &#383;o that between the
performance of their religious duties, and the &#383;acrifice to
their political fears, a larger portion of time will be deducted
from indu&#383;try than was gained by the
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ion of the Saint&#383;' days. The
Pari&#383;ians, however, &#383;eem to acquie&#383;ce very readily
in thi&#383; compromi&#383;e, and the philo&#383;ophers of the
Convention, who have &#383;o often declaimed again&#383;t the
idlene&#383;s occa&#383;ioned by the numerous fetes of the old
calendar, ob&#383;tinately per&#383;i&#383;t in the adoption of a
new one, which increa&#383;es the evil they pretend to remedy.</p>
<p>If the people are to be taken from their labour for &#383;uch a
number of days, it might as well be in the name of St. Genevieve or
St. Denis, a&#383; of the Decade, and the Saint&#383;'-days have at
lea&#383;t this advantage, that the forenoons are pa&#383;&#383;ed
in churches; whereas the republican fe&#383;tivals, dedicated one
to love, another to &#383;toici&#383;m, and &#383;o forth, not
conveying any very determinate idea, are interpreted to mean only
an obligation to do nothing, or to pa&#383;s &#383;ome
&#383;upernumerary hours at the cabaret. [Alehou&#383;e.]</p>
<p>I noticed with extreme plea&#383;ure ye&#383;terday, that as
many of the places of public wor&#383;hip as are permitted to be
open were much crouded, and that religion appears to have
&#383;urvived the lo&#383;s of tho&#383;e exterior allurement&#383;
which might be &#383;uppo&#383;ed to have rendered it peculiarly
attractive to the Pari&#383;ians. The churches at pre&#383;ent, far
from being &#383;plendid, are not even decent, the walls and
windows &#383;till bear traces of the Goths (or, if you will, the
philo&#383;ophers,) and in &#383;ome places &#383;ervice is
celebrated amid&#383;t piles of farage, &#383;acks, ca&#383;ks, or
lumber appertaining to the government&mdash;who, though they have
by their own confe&#383;&#383;ion the di&#383;po&#383;al of half
the metropolis, choo&#383;e the churches in preference for
&#383;uch purpo&#383;es.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It has frequently been a&#383;&#383;erted in the
Convention, that by emigrations, bani&#383;hments, and executions,
half Paris had become the property of the public.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Yet the&#383;e un&#383;eemly and de&#383;olate
appearances do not prevent the attendance of congregations more
numerous, and, I think, more fervent, than were u&#383;ual when the
altars &#383;hone with the offerings of wealth, and the walls were
covered with the more intere&#383;ting decorations of picture&#383;
and tape&#383;try.</p>
<p>This it is not difficult to account for. Many who u&#383;ed to
perform the&#383;e religious duties with negligence, or
indifference, are now become pious, and even
enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic&mdash;and this not from hypocri&#383;y or
political contradiction, but from a real &#383;en&#383;e of the
evils of irreligion, produced by the examples and conduct of
tho&#383;e in whom &#383;uch a tendency has been mo&#383;t
remarkable.&mdash;It mu&#383;t, indeed, be acknowledged, that did
Chri&#383;tianity require an advocate, a more powerful one need not
be found, than in a retro&#383;pect of the crimes and
&#383;ufferings of the French &#383;ince it&#383; abolition.</p>
<p>Tho&#383;e who have made fortunes by the revolution (for very
few have been able to pre&#383;erve them) now begin to exhibit
equipages; and they hope to render the people blind to this
departure from their vi&#383;ionary &#383;y&#383;tems of equality,
by foregoing the u&#383;e of arms and liverie&#383;&mdash;as if the
real difference between the rich and the poor was not
con&#383;tituted rather by e&#383;&#383;ential accommodation, than
extrin&#383;ic embelli&#383;hments, which perhaps do not gratify
the eyes of the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;or a &#383;econd time,
and are, probably of all branches of luxury, the mo&#383;t
u&#383;eful. The livery of &#383;ervants can be of very little
importance, whether morally or politically con&#383;idered&mdash;it
is the act of maintaining men in idlene&#383;s, who might be more
profitably employed, that makes the keeping a great number
exceptionable; nor is a man more degraded by going behind a
carriage with a hat and feather, than with a bonnet de police, or a
plain beaver; but he eats ju&#383;t as much, and earns ju&#383;t as
little, equipped as a Carmagnole, as though glittering in the
mo&#383;t &#383;uperb gala &#383;uit.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* In their zeal to imitate the Roman republicans, the
French &#383;eem to forget that a political con&#383;ideration very
different from the love of &#383;implicity, or an idea of the
dignity of man, made the Roman&#383; aver&#383;e from
di&#383;tingui&#383;hing their &#383;laves by any external
indication. They were &#383;o numerous that it was thought
impolitic to furni&#383;h them with &#383;uch means of knowing
their own &#383;trength in ca&#383;e of a revolt.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The marks of &#383;ervice cannot be more degrading than
&#383;ervice it&#383;elf; and it is the mere chicane of
philo&#383;ophy to extend reform only to cuffs and collars, while
we do not di&#383;pen&#383;e with the &#383;ervices annexed to
them. A valet who walks the &#383;treet in his powdering jacket,
di&#383;dains a livery a&#383; much as the fierce&#383;t
republican, and with as much rea&#383;on&mdash;for there is no more
difference between dome&#383;tic occupation performed in one coat
or another, than there is between the party-coloured habit and the
jacket.</p>
<p>If the luxury of carriages be an evil, it mu&#383;t be
becau&#383;e the hor&#383;e&#383; employed in them con&#383;ume the
produce of land which might be more beneficially cultivated: but
the gilding, fringe, &#383;alamanders, and lions, in all their
heraldic po&#383;itions, afford an ea&#383;y livelihood to
manufacturers and arti&#383;ans, who might not be capable of more
laboriou&#383; occupations.</p>
<p>I believe it will generally be found, that mo&#383;t of the
republican reform&#383; are of this
de&#383;cription&mdash;calculated only to impo&#383;e on the
people, and di&#383;gui&#383;ing, by frivolous prohibitions, their
real inutility. The affectation of &#383;implicity in a nation
already familiarized with luxury, only tends to divert the wealth
of the rich to purpo&#383;es which render it more de&#383;tructive.
Vanity and o&#383;tentation, when they are excluded from one means
of gratification, will always &#383;eek another; and tho&#383;e
who, having the means, cannot di&#383;tingui&#383;h them&#383;elves
by o&#383;ten&#383;ible &#383;plendour, will often do &#383;o by
dome&#383;tic profu&#383;ion.*</p>

Painting, &#383;peaking of the republicans under Cromwell) have no

per&#383;uaded the&#383;e ob&#383;ervations are yet more applicable
to the political, than the religious opinions of the Engli&#383;h
republicans of that period; for, in the&#383;e re&#383;pects, there
is no difference between them and the French of the pre&#383;ent
day, though there is a wide one between an Anabapti&#383;t and the
di&#383;ciples of Boulanger and Voltaire.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;Nor can it well be di&#383;puted, that a gro&#383;s
luxury is more perniciou&#383; than an elegant one; for the former
con&#383;umes the nece&#383;&#383;aries of life wantonly, while the
latter maintains numerous hands in rendering thing&#383; valuable

<p>Every one who has been a reflecting &#383;pectator of the
revolution will acknowledge the ju&#383;tice of the&#383;e
ob&#383;ervations. The agents and retainer&#383; of government are
the general monopolizers of the markets, and the&#383;e men, who
are enriched by peculation, and are on all occa&#383;ions retailing

<blockquote>Extract of a denunciation of Citizen Boi&#383;martin
again&#383;t Citizen Laplanche, member of the National Convention:
"The twenty-fourth of Brumaire, in the &#383;econd year of the
republic, the Admini&#383;trators of the di&#383;trict of St. Lo
gave orders to the municipality over which I at that time
pre&#383;ided, to lodge the Repre&#383;entative of the people,
Laplanche, and General Siphert, in the hou&#383;e of Citizen
Lemonnier, who was then under arre&#383;t at Thorigni. In
introducing one of the founders of the republic, and a French
General, into this ho&#383;pitable man&#383;ion, we thought to put
the property of our fellow-citizen under the &#383;afeguard of all
the virtues; but, alas, how were we mi&#383;taken! They had no
&#383;ooner entered the hou&#383;e, than the provi&#383;ions of
every &#383;ort, the linen, clothes, furniture, trinkets, books,
plate, carriages, and even title-deeds, all di&#383;appeared; and,
as if they purpo&#383;ely in&#383;ulted our wretchedne&#383;s,
while we were reduced to the &#383;ad nece&#383;&#383;ity of
di&#383;tributing with a par&#383;imonious hand a few ounces of
black bread to our fellow-citizens, the be&#383;t bread, pillaged
from Citizen Lemonnier, was lavi&#383;hed by buckets full to the
hor&#383;es of General Siphert, and the Repre&#383;entative
Laplanche.&mdash;The Citizen Lemonnier, who is &#383;eventy years
of age, having now recovered his liberty, which he never
de&#383;erved to lo&#383;e, finds him&#383;elf &#383;o entirely
de&#383;poiled, that he is at pre&#383;ent obliged to live at an
inn; and, of property to the amount of &#383;ixty thou&#383;and
livres, he has nothing left but a &#383;ingle &#383;poon, which he
took with him when carried to one of the Ba&#383;tille&#383; in the
department de la Manche." The chief defence of Laplanche
con&#383;i&#383;ted in allegations that the &#383;aid Citizen
Lemonnier was rich, and a royali&#383;t, and that he had found
emblems of royali&#383;m and fanatici&#383;m about the
hou&#383;e.</blockquote>

<p>At the hou&#383;e of one of our common friends, I met

he had e&#383;caped all the revolutionary perils to which he had
been expo&#383;ed, that I could almo&#383;t have &#383;uppo&#383;ed
my&#383;elf in the regions of the dead, or that he had been
permitted to quit them, for hi&#383; being alive &#383;carcely
&#383;eemed le&#383;s miraculous or incredible. As I had not
&#383;een him &#383;ince 1792, he gave me a very intere&#383;ting
detail of hi&#383; adventures, and his te&#383;timony corroborates
the opinion generally entertained by tho&#383;e who knew the late
King, that he had much per&#383;onal courage, and that he lo&#383;t
his crown and his life by political indeci&#383;ion, and an humane,
but ill-judged, unwillingne&#383;s to reduce his enemies by force.
He a&#383;&#383;ured me, the Queen might have been conveyed out of
France previous to the tenth of Augu&#383;t, if &#383;he would have
agreed to leave the King and her children behind; that &#383;he had
twice con&#383;ulted him on the &#383;ubject; but,
per&#383;i&#383;ting in her re&#383;olution not to depart

<p>This, as well as many other in&#383;tances of tenderne&#383;s

mi&#383;fortunes, accord but ill with the vices imputed to her; and

cau&#383;e of faction, rather than that of morality, the&#383;e
incon&#383;i&#383;tencie&#383; would have been interpreted in her

which they were &#383;ucceeded.</p>
<p>I had, in compliance with your reque&#383;t on my fir&#383;t
arrival in France, made a collection of prints of all the mo&#383;t
con&#383;picuous actors in the revolution; but as they could not be
&#383;ecreted &#383;o ea&#383;ily as other papers, my fears
overcame my de&#383;ire of obliging you, and I de&#383;troyed them
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively, as the originals became
pro&#383;cribed or were &#383;acrificed. De&#383;irous of repairing
my lo&#383;s, I per&#383;uaded &#383;ome friends to accompany me to
a &#383;hop, kept by a man of whom they frequently purcha&#383;ed,
and whom, a&#383; his principles were known to them, I might
&#383;afely a&#383;k for the articles I wanted. He &#383;hook his
head, while he ran over my li&#383;t, and then told me, that having
preferred his &#383;afety to his property, he had
di&#383;po&#383;ed of hi&#383; prints in the &#383;ame way I had
di&#383;po&#383;ed of mine. "At the acce&#383;&#383;ion of a new
party, (continued he,) I always prepare for a domiciliary
vi&#383;it, clear my windows and &#383;helves of the exploded
heads, and replace them by tho&#383;e of their rivals. Nay, I
a&#383;&#383;ure you, &#383;ince the revolution, our trade is
become as precarious as that of a game&#383;ter. The
Con&#383;titutionali&#383;ts, indeed, held out pretty well, but
then I was half ruined by the fall of the Bri&#383;&#383;otins;
and, before I could retrieve a little by the Heberti&#383;ts and
Dantoni&#383;ts, the too were out of fa&#383;hion."&mdash; "Well,
but the Robe&#383;pierrian&#383;&mdash;you mu&#383;t have gained by
them?"&mdash;"Why, true; Robe&#383;pierre and Marat, and Chalier,
an&#383;wered well enough, becau&#383;e the royali&#383;ts
generally placed them in their hou&#383;es to give them&#383;elves
an air of patrioti&#383;m, yet they are gone after the
re&#383;t.&mdash;Here, however, (&#383;ays he, taking down an
engraving of the Abbe Sieyes,) is a piece of merchandize that I
have kept through all parties, religions, and
con&#383;titution&#383;&mdash;<i>et le voila encore a la mode,</i>
["And now you &#383;ee him in fa&#383;hion again."] mounted on the
wrecks, and &#383;upported by the remnants of both his friends and
enemies. <i>Ah! c'e&#383;t un fin matois."</i> ["Ah! He's a knowing
one."]</p>
<p>This conver&#383;ation pa&#383;&#383;ed in a gay tone, though
the man added, very &#383;eriou&#383;ly, that the in&#383;tability
of popular factions, and their intolerance towards each other, had
obliged him to de&#383;troy to the amount of &#383;ome
thou&#383;and livres, and that he intended, if affairs did not
change, to quit bu&#383;ine&#383;s.</p>
<p>Of all the prints I enquired for, I only got Barrere, Sieyes,
and a few others of le&#383;s note. Your la&#383;t
commi&#383;&#383;ions I have executed more
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;fully, for though the nece&#383;&#383;aries
of life are almo&#383;t unpurcha&#383;eable, articles of
ta&#383;te, books, perfumery, &amp;c. are cheaper than ever. This
is unfortunately the rever&#383;e of what ought to be the
ca&#383;e, but the augmentation in the price of provi&#383;ions is
to be accounted for in various ways, and that things of the
de&#383;cription I allude to do not bear a price in proportion is
doubtle&#383;s to be attributed to the pre&#383;ent poverty of
tho&#383;e who u&#383;ed to be the purcha&#383;ers of them; while
the people who are become rich under the new government are of a
de&#383;cription to &#383;eek for more &#383;ub&#383;tantial
luxuries than books and e&#383;&#383;ences.&mdash;I &#383;hould
however ob&#383;erve, that the venders of any thing not
peri&#383;hable, and who are not forced to &#383;ell for their
daily &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence, are &#383;olicitous to evade
every demand for any article which is to be paid for in
a&#383;&#383;ignats.</p>
<p>I was looking at &#383;ome trinkets in a &#383;hop at the Palais
Royal, and on my a&#383;king the mi&#383;tre&#383;s of it if the
ornaments were &#383;ilver, &#383;he &#383;miled
&#383;ignificantly, and replied, &#383;he had nothing &#383;ilver
nor gold in the &#383;hop, but if I cho&#383;e to purcha&#383;e
<i>en e&#383;pece,</i> &#383;he would &#383;how me whatever I
de&#383;ired: <i>"Mais pour le papier nous n'en avons que
trop."</i> ["In coin, but for paper we have already too much of
it."]</p>
<p>Many of the old &#383;hops are nearly empty, and the little
trade which yet exi&#383;ts is carried on by a &#383;ort of
adventurers who, without being bred to any one trade, &#383;et up
half a dozen, and perhaps di&#383;appear three month&#383;
afterwards. They are, I believe, chiefly men who have
&#383;peculated on the a&#383;&#383;ignats, and as &#383;oon as
they have turned their capital in a mercantile way a &#383;hort
time, become apprehen&#383;ive of the paper, realize it, and
retire; or, becoming bankrupts by &#383;ome unlucky monopoly, begin
a new career of patrioti&#383;m.</p>
<p>There is, properly &#383;peaking, no money in circulation, yet a
va&#383;t quantity is bought and &#383;old. Annuitants,
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ors of moderate landed property,
&amp;c., finding it impo&#383;&#383;ible to &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;t
on their incomes, are forced to have recour&#383;e to the little
&#383;pecie they have re&#383;erved, and exchange it for paper.
Immen&#383;e &#383;ums in coin are purcha&#383;ed by the
government, to make good the balance of their trade with the
neutral countries for provi&#383;ions, &#383;o that I &#383;hould
&#383;uppo&#383;e, if this continue a few months, very little will
be left in the country.</p>
<p>One might be tempted to fancy there is &#383;omething in the
atmo&#383;phere of Paris which adapts the minds of its inhabitants
to their political &#383;ituation. They talk of the day appointed
for a revolt a fortnight before, as though it were a fete, and the
mo&#383;t timid begin to be inured to a &#383;tate of agitation and
apprehen&#383;ion, and to con&#383;ider it as a natural
vici&#383;&#383;itude that their lives &#383;hould be endangered
periodically.</p>
<p>A commi&#383;&#383;ion has been employed for &#383;ome time in
devi&#383;ing another new con&#383;titution, which is to be
propo&#383;ed to the A&#383;&#383;embly on the thirteenth of this
month; and on that day, it is &#383;aid, an effort is to be made by
the royali&#383;ts. They are certainly very numerous, and the
intere&#383;t taken in the young King is univer&#383;al. In vain
have the journali&#383;ts been forbidden to cheri&#383;h the&#383;e
&#383;entiments, by publi&#383;hing details concerning him:
whatever e&#383;capes the walls of his pri&#383;on is circulated in
impatient whi&#383;pers, and requires neither printing nor gazettes
a la main to give it publicity.*</p>

judged it expedient to fortify the&#383;e heroic
di&#383;po&#383;itions by the aid of a military force, and a large
number of regular troops are in Paris and the environs. We

<p>Our journey here was, in fact, unnece&#383;&#383;ary; but we
have few republican acquaintance, and tho&#383;e who are called

accident: either a riot between the Terrori&#383;ts and
Mu&#383;cadins, within, or a military inve&#383;tment without. The

<p>&mdash;Adieu.</p>
<p>Paris, June 12, 1795.</p>
<p>The hopes and fears, plots and counterplots, of both
royali&#383;ts and republicans, are now &#383;u&#383;pended by the
death of the young King. Thi&#383; event was announced on
Tue&#383;day la&#383;t, and &#383;ince that time the minds and
conver&#383;ation of the public have been entirely occupied by it.
Latent &#383;u&#383;picion, and regret unwillingly
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed, are every where vi&#383;ible; and, in
the fond intere&#383;t taken in this child's life, it &#383;eems to
be forgotten that it is the lot of man "to pa&#383;s through nature
to eternity," and that it was po&#383;&#383;ible for him to die
without being &#383;acrificed by human malice.</p>
<p>All that has been &#383;aid and written on original equality has
not yet per&#383;uaded the people that the fate of Kings is
regulated only by the ordinary di&#383;pen&#383;ations of
Providence; and they &#383;eem to per&#383;i&#383;t in believing,
that royalty, if it has not a more fortunate pre-eminence, i&#383;
at lea&#383;t di&#383;tingui&#383;hed by an unu&#383;ual portion of
calamities.</p>
<p>When we recollect the various and ab&#383;urd &#383;tories which
have been propagated and believed at the death of Monarchs or their
off&#383;pring, without even a &#383;ingle ground either political
or phy&#383;ical to ju&#383;tify them, we cannot now wonder, when
&#383;o many circum&#383;tances of every kind tend to excite
&#383;u&#383;picion, that the public opinion &#383;hould be
influenced, and attribute the death of the King to poi&#383;on. The
child is allowed to have been of a lively di&#383;po&#383;ition,
and, even long after his &#383;eclu&#383;ion from hi&#383; family,
to have frequently amu&#383;ed him&#383;elf by &#383;inging at the
window of hi&#383; pri&#383;on, until the intere&#383;t he was
ob&#383;erved to create in tho&#383;e who li&#383;tened under it,
occa&#383;ioned an order to prevent him. It is therefore
extraordinary, that he &#383;hould lately have appeared in a
&#383;tate of &#383;tupefaction, which is by no means a
&#383;ymptom of the di&#383;order he i&#383; alledged to have died
of, but a very common one of opiates improperly
admini&#383;tered.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* In order to account in &#383;ome way for the
&#383;tate in which the young King had lately appeared, it was
reported that he had been in the habit of drinking &#383;trong
liquors to exce&#383;s. Admitting this to be true, they mu&#383;t
have been furni&#383;hed for him, for he could have no means of
procuring them.&mdash;It is not inappo&#383;ite to record, that on
a petition being formerly pre&#383;ented to the legi&#383;lature
from the Jacobin &#383;ocieties, praying that the "&#383;on of the
tyrant" might be put to death, an honourable mention in the
national bulletin wa&#383; unanimou&#383;ly decreed!!!</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Though this pre&#383;umption, if &#383;upported by the evidence
of external appearances, may &#383;eem but of little weight; when
combined with others, of a moral and political nature, it becomes
of con&#383;iderable importance. The people, long amu&#383;ed by a
&#383;uppo&#383;ed de&#383;ign of the Convention to place the
Dauphin on the throne, were now become impatient to &#383;ee their
wi&#383;he&#383; realized; or, they hoped that a renewal of the
repre&#383;entative body, which, if conducted with freedom,
mu&#383;t infallibly lead to the accompli&#383;hment of this
object, would at lea&#383;t deliver them from an A&#383;&#383;embly
which they con&#383;idered as exhau&#383;ted in talents and
degraded in reputation.&mdash;The&#383;e di&#383;po&#383;itions
were not attempted to be concealed; they were manife&#383;ted on
all occa&#383;ions: and a general and &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful
effort in favour of the Royal Pri&#383;oner was expected to take
place on the thirteenth.*</p>

<p>&mdash;The remains of the Bri&#383;&#383;otins, with their
newly-acquired authority, have vanity, intere&#383;t, and revenge,
to &#383;atiate; and there is no rea&#383;on to &#383;uppo&#383;e
that a crime, which &#383;hould favour the&#383;e views, would, in
their e&#383;timation, be con&#383;idered otherwi&#383;e than
venial. To the&#383;e are added Sieyes, Louvet, &amp;c. men not
only eager to retain their power, but known to have been of the
Orleans faction, and who, if they are royali&#383;ts, are not
loyali&#383;ts, and the la&#383;t per&#383;ons to who&#383;e care a

<p>At this cri&#383;is, then, when the Convention could no longer
temporize with the expectations it rai&#383;ed&mdash;when the
government was divided between one party who had depo&#383;ed the
King to gratify their own ambition, and another who had lent their
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance in order to facilitate the
preten&#383;ions of an u&#383;urper&mdash;and when the hopes of the
country were anxiou&#383;ly fixed on him, died Louis the
Seventeenth. At an age which, in common life, i&#383; perhaps the
only portion of our exi&#383;tence unalloyed by mi&#383;ery,
thi&#383; innocent child had &#383;uffered more than is often the
lot of extended year&#383; and mature guilt. He lived to &#383;ee
his father &#383;ent to the &#383;caffold&mdash;to be torn from his
mother and family&mdash;to drudge in the &#383;ervice of brutality
and in&#383;olence&mdash;and to want tho&#383;e cares and
nece&#383;&#383;aries which are not refu&#383;ed even to the infant

and in any other drudgery of which his clo&#383;e confinement
admitted.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;When his death was announced to the Convention,
Seve&#383;tre, the reporter, acknowledged that De&#383;&#383;ault,
the &#383;urgeon, had &#383;ome time &#383;ince declared the
ca&#383;e to be dangerous; yet, notwith&#383;tanding policy as well
as humanity required that every appearance of my&#383;tery and
har&#383;hne&#383;s &#383;hould, on &#383;uch an occa&#383;ion, be
avoided, the poor child continued to be &#383;ecluded with the
&#383;ame barbarous jealou&#383;y&mdash;nor was the Prince&#383;s,
his &#383;i&#383;ter, who&#383;e evidence on the &#383;ubject would
have been &#383;o conclu&#383;ive, ever &#383;uffered to approach
him.</p>
<p>No report of De&#383;&#383;ault's opinion had till now been made
public; and De&#383;&#383;ault him&#383;elf, who was an hone&#383;t
man, died of an inflammatory di&#383;order four days before the
Dauphin.&mdash;It is po&#383;&#383;ible, he might have
expre&#383;&#383;ed him&#383;elf too freely, re&#383;pecting his
patient, to tho&#383;e who employed him&mdash; his future
di&#383;cretion might be doubted&mdash;or, perhaps, he was only
called in at fir&#383;t, that his character might give a
&#383;anction to the future operations of tho&#383;e who were more
confided in. But whether this event i&#383; to be a&#383;cribed to
natural cau&#383;es, or to that of opiates, the times and
circum&#383;tances render it peculiarly liable to
&#383;u&#383;picions, and the reputation of tho&#383;e who are
involved, is not calculated to repel them. Indeed, &#383;o
con&#383;cious are the advocates of government, that the imputation
cannot be obviated by pleading the integrity of the parties, that
they &#383;eem to re&#383;t their &#383;ole defence on the
inutility of a murder, which only tran&#383;fers whatever rights
the Hou&#383;e of Bourbon may be &#383;uppo&#383;ed to
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s, from one branch of it to another. Yet
tho&#383;e who make u&#383;e of this argument are well aware of its
fallaciou&#383;ne&#383;s: the &#383;hades of political opinion in
France are extremely diver&#383;ified, and a con&#383;iderable part
of the Royali&#383;ts are al&#383;o Con&#383;titutionali&#383;ts,
whom it will require time and nece&#383;&#383;ity to reconcile to
the emigrant Princes. But the young King had neither enemies nor
error&#383;&mdash;and his claims would have united the efforts and
affections of all parties, from the friends of the monarchy, as it
exi&#383;ted under Louis the Fourteenth, down to the converted
Republican, who compromi&#383;es with his principles, and
&#383;tipulates for the title of Perpetual Pre&#383;ident.</p>
<p>That the removal of this child has been fortunate for tho&#383;e
who govern, is proved by the effect: in&#383;urrections are no
longer talked of, the royali&#383;ts are confounded, the point of
intere&#383;t is no more, and a &#383;ort of de&#383;pondency and
confu&#383;ion prevails, which is highly favourable to a
continuance of the pre&#383;ent &#383;y&#383;tem.&mdash;There is no
doubt, but that when men's minds become more &#383;ettled, the
advantage of having a Prince who i&#383; capable of acting, and
who&#383;e &#383;ucce&#383;s will not be accompanied by a long
minority, will conciliate all the reflecting part of the
con&#383;titutional royali&#383;ts, in &#383;pite of their
political objections. But the people who are more under the
influence of their feelings, and yield le&#383;s to expediency, may
not, till urged by di&#383;tre&#383;s and anarchy, be brought to
take the &#383;ame intere&#383;t in the ab&#383;ent claimant of the
throne, that they did in their infant Prince.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted, that an habitual and unconquerable
deference for the law which excludes females from the Crown of
France, &#383;hould have &#383;urvived monarchy it&#383;elf;
otherwi&#383;e the tender compa&#383;&#383;ion excited by the
youth, beauty and &#383;ufferings of the Prince&#383;s, might yet
have been the means of procuring peace to this di&#383;tracted
country. But the French admire, lament, and leave her to her
fate&mdash;</p>

pa&#383;s half my time in vi&#383;iting the &#383;pots where they
were perpetrated. It was but to-day I was reque&#383;ted to go and

the purpo&#383;e.*</p>

were employed in taking it up in buckets, and conveying it to this

<p>&mdash;The&#383;e barbarous propen&#383;ities have long been the

country that ever had been civilized, and &#383;till le&#383;s in
one that had not.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It would be too &#383;hocking, both to decency and
humanity, to recite the more &#383;erious enormities alluded to;
and I only add, to tho&#383;e I have formerly mentioned, a few
examples which particularly de&#383;cribe the manners of the
revolution.&mdash; At Metz, the heads of the guillotined were
placed on the tops of their own hou&#383;es. The Guillotine was
&#383;tationary, fronting the Town-hou&#383;e, for months; and
whoever was ob&#383;erved to pa&#383;s it with looks of
di&#383;approbation, was marked as an object of
&#383;u&#383;picion. A popular Commi&#383;&#383;ion,
in&#383;tituted for receiving the revolutionary tax at this place,
held their meetings in a room hung with &#383;tripes of red and
black, lighted only with &#383;epulchral lamps; and on the
de&#383;k was placed a &#383;mall Guillotine, &#383;urrounded by
daggers and &#383;words. In this vault, and amid&#383;t this gloomy
apparatus, the inhabitants of Metz brought their patriotic gifts,
(that is, the arbitrary and exorbitant contributions to which they
were condemned,) and laid them on the altar of the Guillotine, like
the &#383;acrifice of fear to the infernal deities; and, that the
keeping of the whole bu&#383;ine&#383;&#383; might be
pre&#383;erved, the receipts were &#383;igned with red ink,
avowedly intended as expre&#383;&#383;ive of the reigning
&#383;y&#383;tem. At Cahors, the deputy, Taillefer, after making a
triumphal entry with &#383;everal waggons full of people whom he
had arre&#383;ted, ordered a Guillotine to be erected in the
&#383;quare, and &#383;ome of the pri&#383;oners to be brought
forth and decorated in a mock co&#383;tume repre&#383;enting Kings,
Queens, and Nobility. He then obliged them
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ively to pay homage to the Guillotine, as
though it had been a throne, the executioner manoeuvring the
in&#383;trument all the while, and exciting the people to call for
the heads of tho&#383;e who were forced to act in this horrid
farce. The attempt, however, did not &#383;ucceed, and the
&#383;pectators retired in &#383;ilent indignation. At Laval, the
head of Laroche, a deputy of the Con&#383;tituent
A&#383;&#383;embly, was exhibited (by order of Lavallee, a deputy
there on mi&#383;&#383;ion) on the hou&#383;e inhabited by his
wife.&mdash;At Auch, in the department of Gers, d'Artigoyte,
another deputy, obliged &#383;ome of the people under arre&#383;t
to eat out of a manger.&mdash;Borie u&#383;ed to amu&#383;e
him&#383;elf, and the inhabitants of Ni&#383;mes, by dancing what
he called a farandole round the Guillotine in his legi&#383;lative
co&#383;tume.&mdash;The repre&#383;entative Lejeune &#383;olaced
his lei&#383;ure hours in beheading animals with a miniature
Guillotine, the expence of which he had placed to the account of
the nation; and &#383;o much was he delighted with it, that the
poultry &#383;erved at his table were &#383;ubmitted to its
operation, a&#383; well as the fruits at his de&#383;&#383;ert!
(Debates, June 1.) But it would be tedious and di&#383;gu&#383;ting
to de&#383;cribe all the <i>menu&#383; plai&#383;ir&#383;</i> of
the&#383;e founders of the French republic. Let it &#383;uffice to
&#383;ay, that they compri&#383;ed whatever is ludicrous,
&#383;anguinary, and licentious, and that &#383;uch examples were
but too &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful in procuring imitators. At Tours,
even the women wore Guillotines in their ears, and it was not
unu&#383;ual for people to &#383;eal their letter&#383; with a
&#383;imilar repre&#383;entation!</blockquote>

<h2>Paris, June 15, 1795.</h2>
<p>I am now, after a re&#383;idence of more than three years,
amid&#383;t the chaos of a revolution, on the eve of my departure
from France. Yet, while I joyfully prepare to revi&#383;it my own
country, my mind involuntarily trace&#383; the rapid
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ion of calamities which have filled this
period, and dwells with painful contemplation on tho&#383;e changes
in the morals and condition of the French people that &#383;eem
hitherto to be the only fruit&#383; which they have produced. In
this recurrence to the pa&#383;t, and e&#383;timation of the
pre&#383;ent, however we may regret the per&#383;ecution of wealth,
the de&#383;truction of commerce, and the general
oppre&#383;&#383;ion, the mo&#383;t important and irretrievable
mi&#383;chief of the revolution is, doubtle&#383;s, the corruption
of manners introduced among the middle and lower cla&#383;&#383;es
of the people.</p>
<p>The labouring poor of France have often been de&#383;cribed as
frugal, thoughtle&#383;s, and happy, earning, indeed, but little,
yet &#383;pending &#383;till le&#383;s, and in general able to
procure &#383;uch a &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;tence as their habit&#383;
and climate rendered agreeable and &#383;ufficient.*</p>

<blockquote>* Mr. Young &#383;eems to have been per&#383;uaded,
that the common people of France worked harder, and were wor&#383;e
fed, than tho&#383;e of the &#383;ame de&#383;cription in England.
Yet, as far as I have had opportunity of ob&#383;erving, and from
the information I have been able to procure, I cannot help
&#383;uppo&#383;ing that this gentleman has drawn his inference
partially, and that he has often compared &#383;ome particular
ca&#383;e of di&#383;tre&#383;s, with the general &#383;ituation of
the pea&#383;antry in the rich counties, which are the &#383;cene
of his experiments. The pea&#383;antry of many di&#383;tant parts
of England fare as coar&#383;ely, and labour harder, than was
common in France; and taking their habits of frugality, their
di&#383;po&#383;ition to be &#383;ati&#383;fied, and their climate
into the account, the &#383;ituation of the French perhaps was
preferable. Mr. Young's Tour has been quoted very triumphantly by a
Noble Lord, particularly a pa&#383;&#383;age which laments and
a&#383;cribes to political cau&#383;es the appearance of premature
old age, ob&#383;ervable in French women of the lower
cla&#383;&#383;es. Yet, for the &#383;ati&#383;faction of hi&#383;
Lord&#383;hip's benevolence and gallantry, I can a&#383;&#383;ure
him, that the female pea&#383;ants in France have not more
laborious occupations than tho&#383;e of England, but they wear no
&#383;tays, and expo&#383;e them&#383;elves to all weathers without
hats; in con&#383;equence, lo&#383;e their &#383;hape, tan their
complexions, and harden their features &#383;o as to look much
older than they really are.&mdash;Mr. Young's book is
tran&#383;lated into French, and I have too high an opinion both of
his principles and his talents to doubt that he mu&#383;t regret
the ill effects it may have had in France, and the u&#383;e that
has been made of it in England.</blockquote>

ta&#383;te for expence. They work with de&#383;pair and
unwillingne&#383;s, becau&#383;e they can no longer live by their
labour; and, alternately the victims of intemperance or want, they
are often to be found in a &#383;tate of intoxication, when they
have not been able to &#383;ati&#383;fy their hunger&mdash;for, as
bread cannot always be purcha&#383;ed with paper, they procure a
temporary &#383;upport, at the expence of their health and morals,
in the de&#383;tructive &#383;ub&#383;titute of &#383;trong
liquors.</p>
<p>Tho&#383;e of the next cla&#383;s, &#383;uch as working
trade&#383;men, artizans, and dome&#383;tic &#383;ervants, though
le&#383;s wretched, are far more di&#383;&#383;olute; and it is not
uncommon in great towns to &#383;ee men of this de&#383;cription
unite the ferociou&#383;ne&#383;s of &#383;avages with all the
vices of &#383;y&#383;tematic profligacy. The original principles
of the revolution, of them&#383;elves, naturally tended to produce
&#383;uch a depravation; but the &#383;u&#383;pen&#383;ion of
religiou&#383; wor&#383;hip, the conduct of the Deputies on
mi&#383;&#383;ion, and the univer&#383;al immorality of the
exi&#383;ting government, mu&#383;t have con&#383;iderably
ha&#383;tened it. When the people were forbidden the exerci&#383;e
of their religion, though they did not cea&#383;e to be attached to
it, yet they lo&#383;t the good effects which even external forms
alone are calculated to produce; and while dei&#383;m and
athei&#383;m failed in perverting their faith, they were but too
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful in corrupting their morals.</p>
<p>As in all countries the re&#383;traints which religion
impo&#383;es are more readily &#383;ubmitted to by the inferior
ranks of life, it is the&#383;e which mu&#383;t be mo&#383;t
affected by its abolition; and we cannot wonder, that when men have
been once accu&#383;tomed to neglect the duty they con&#383;ider as
mo&#383;t e&#383;&#383;ential, they &#383;hould in time become
capable of violating every other: for, however it may be among the
learned, <i>qui &#383;'aveuglent a force de lumiere,</i> [Who blind
them&#383;elves by exce&#383;s of light. De&#383;touchet.] with the
ignorant the tran&#383;ition from religious indifference to actual
vice i&#383; rapid and certain.</p>
<p>The Mi&#383;&#383;ionaries of the Convention, who for two years
extended their de&#383;tructive depredations over the departments,
were every where guilty of the mo&#383;t odious exce&#383;&#383;es,
and tho&#383;e lea&#383;t culpable offered examples of
licentiou&#383;ne&#383;s and intemperance with which, till then,
the people had never been familiar.*</p>

<blockquote>* "When the Convention was elected, (&#383;ays Durand
Maillane, &#383;ee Report of the Committee of Legi&#383;lation,
13th Prairial, 1&#383;t June,) the choice fell upon men who
abu&#383;ed the name of patriot, and adopted it as a cloak for
their vices.&mdash;Vainly do we inculcate ju&#383;tice, and expect
the Tribunals will bring thieves and a&#383;&#383;a&#383;&#383;ins
to puni&#383;hment, if we do not puni&#383;h tho&#383;e
among&#383;t our&#383;elves.&mdash;Vainly &#383;hall we talk of
republican manners and democratic government, while our
repre&#383;entatives carry into the departments examples of
de&#383;poti&#383;m and corruption." The conduct of the&#383;e
civilized banditti has been &#383;ufficiently de&#383;cribed.
Allard, Laco&#383;te, Mallarme, Milhaud, Laplanche, Mone&#383;tier,
Guyardin, Sergent, and many others, were not only ferocious and
extravagant, but known to have been guilty of the meane&#383;t
thefts. Javoques is alledged to have &#383;acrificed two hundred
people of Montibri&#383;on, and to have &#383;tolen a va&#383;t
quantity of their effects. It was common for him to &#383;ay, that
he acknowledged as true patriots tho&#383;e only who, like
him&#383;elf, <i>"etaient capables de boire une verre de
&#383;ang,"</i>&mdash;("were capable of drinking a gla&#383;s of
blood.") D'Artigoyte di&#383;tingui&#383;hed him&#383;elf by
&#383;uch &#383;candalous violations of morals and decency, that
they are not fit to be recited. He often obliged married women, by
menaces, to bring their daughters to the Jacobin clubs, for the
purpo&#383;e of in&#383;ulting them with the
gro&#383;&#383;e&#383;t ob&#383;cenities.&mdash;Having a project of
getting up a play for hi&#383; amu&#383;ement, he cau&#383;ed it to
be declared, that tho&#383;e who had any talents for acting, and
did not pre&#383;ent them&#383;elves, &#383;hould be
impri&#383;oned as &#383;u&#383;pects. And it is notorious, that
this &#383;ame Deputy once in&#383;ulted all the women pre&#383;ent
at the theatre, and, after u&#383;ing the mo&#383;t ob&#383;cene
language for &#383;ome time, concluded by &#383;tripping
him&#383;elf entirely in pre&#383;ence of the &#383;pectators.
Report of the Committee of Legi&#383;lation, 13th Prairial
(1&#383;t of June). Laco&#383;te and Baudet, when they were on
mi&#383;&#383;ion at Stra&#383;burgh, lived in daily riot and
intoxication with the members of the Revolutionary Tribunal, who,
after qualifying them&#383;elves in the&#383;e orgies, proceeded to
condemn all the pri&#383;oners brought before them.&mdash;During
the debate following the above quoted report, Dentzel accu&#383;ed
Laco&#383;te, among other larcenies, of having purloined &#383;ome
&#383;hirt&#383; belonging to him&#383;elf; and
addre&#383;&#383;ing Laco&#383;te, who was pre&#383;ent in the
A&#383;&#383;embly, with true democratic frankne&#383;s, adds,
<i>"Je &#383;uis &#383;ur qu'il en a une &#383;ur le
corps."</i>&mdash;("I am certain he has one of them on at this
moment.") Debate, 1&#383;t of June. The following is a
tran&#383;lation of a letter from Piorry, Repre&#383;entative of
the People, to the popular &#383;ociety of Poitiers:&mdash; "My
hone&#383;t and determined <i>Sans Culottes,</i> as you &#383;eemed
to de&#383;ire a Deputy among&#383;t you who has never deviated
from the right principles, that is to &#383;ay, a true
Mountaineeer, I fulfil your wi&#383;hes in &#383;ending you the
Citizen Ingrand.&mdash;Remember, hone&#383;t and determined
<i>San&#383; Culottes,</i> that with the &#383;anction of the
patriot Ingrand, you may do every thing, obtain every thing,
de&#383;troy every thing&mdash;impri&#383;on all, try all,
tran&#383;port all, or guillotine all. Don't &#383;pare him a
moment; and thus, through his means, all may tremble, every thing
be &#383;wept away, and, finally, be re-e&#383;tabli&#383;hed in
la&#383;ting order. (Signed) "Piorry." The gentleman who
tran&#383;lated the above for me, &#383;ubjoined, that he had
omitted various oaths too bad for tran&#383;lation.&mdash;This
Piorry always attended the executions, and as fa&#383;t as a head
fell, u&#383;ed to wave his hat in the air, and cry, <i>"Vive la
Republique!"</i> Such are the founders of the French Republic, and
&#383;uch the means by which it has been
&#383;upported!</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;It may be admitted, that the lives of the higher
Noble&#383;&#383;e were not always edifying; but if their
di&#383;&#383;ipation was public, their vices were le&#383;s
&#383;o, and the &#383;cenes of both were for the mo&#383;t part
confined to Paris. What they did not practi&#383;e them&#383;elves,
they at lea&#383;t did not di&#383;courage in others; and though
they might be too indolent to endeavour at pre&#383;erving the
morals of their dependents, they knew their own intere&#383;t too
well to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t in depraving them.</p>
<p>But the Repre&#383;entatives, and their agents, are not to be
con&#383;idered merely as individuals who have corrupted only by
example;&mdash;they were armed with unlimited authority, and made
pro&#383;elytes through fear, where they failed to produce them
from inclination. A contempt for religion or decency has been
con&#383;idered as the te&#383;t of an attachment to the
government; and a gro&#383;s infraction of any moral or &#383;ocial
duty as a proof of civi&#383;m, and a victory over prejudice.
Whoever dreaded an arre&#383;t, or courted an office, affected
profanene&#383;s and profligacy&mdash;and, doubtle&#383;s, many who
at fir&#383;t a&#383;&#383;umed an appearance of vice from
timidity, in the end contracted a preference for it. I my&#383;elf
know in&#383;tances of &#383;everal who began by deploring that
they were no longer able to practi&#383;e the dutie&#383; of their
religion, and ended by ridiculing or fearing them.
Indu&#383;triou&#383; mechanics, who u&#383;ed to go regularly to
ma&#383;s, and be&#383;tow their weekly <i>liard</i> on the poor,
after a month's revolutioni&#383;ing, in the &#383;uite of a
Deputy, have danced round the flames which con&#383;umed the
&#383;acred writings, and become as licentious and
di&#383;hone&#383;t as their leader.</p>
<p>The general principles of the Convention have been adapted to
&#383;anction and accelerate the labours of their itinerant
colleagues. The &#383;entence&#383; of felons were often
rever&#383;ed, in con&#383;ideration of their
"patrioti&#383;m"&mdash; women of &#383;candalous lives have been
pen&#383;ioned, and complimented publicly &mdash;and various
decrees pa&#383;&#383;ed, all tending to promote a national
di&#383;&#383;olutene&#383;s of manners.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* Among others, a decree which gave all illegitimate
children a claim to an equal participation in the property of the
father to whom they &#383;hould (at the di&#383;cretion of the
mother) be attributed.</blockquote>

<p>&mdash;The evil propen&#383;ities of our nature, which penal
laws and morali&#383;t&#383; vainly contend again&#383;t, were
fo&#383;tered by prai&#383;e, and &#383;timulated by
reward&mdash;all the e&#383;tabli&#383;hed di&#383;tinctions of
right and wrong confounded&mdash; and a &#383;y&#383;tem of
revolutionary ethics adopted, not le&#383;s incompatible with the
happine&#383;s of mankind than revolutionary politics.</p>
<p>Thus, all the purpo&#383;es for which this general
demoralization wa&#383; promoted, being at length attained,
tho&#383;e who were rich having been pillaged, tho&#383;e who were
feared ma&#383;&#383;acred, and a croud of needy and de&#383;perate
adventurers attached to the fate of the revolution, the expediency
of a reform has lately been &#383;ugge&#383;ted. But the
mi&#383;chief i&#383; already irreparable. Whatever was good in the
national character i&#383; vitiated; and I do not &#383;cruple to
a&#383;&#383;ert, that the revolution has both de&#383;troyed the
morals of the people, and rendered their condition le&#383;&#383;
happy*&mdash;that they are not only removed to a greater
di&#383;tance from the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of rational
liberty, but are become more unfit for it than ever.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It has been a&#383;&#383;erted, with a view to
&#383;erve the purpo&#383;es of party, that the condition of the
lower cla&#383;&#383;es in France was mended by the revolution. If
tho&#383;e who advance this were not either partial or
ill-informed, they would ob&#383;erve that the large&#383;&#383;es
of the Convention are always intended to palliate &#383;ome
mi&#383;ery, the con&#383;equence of the revolution, and not to
bani&#383;h what is &#383;aid to have exi&#383;ted before. For the
mo&#383;t part, the&#383;e philanthropic projects are never carried
into effect, and when they are, it is to an&#383;wer political
purpo&#383;es.&mdash;For in&#383;tance, many idle people are kept
in pay to applaud at the debates and executions, and
a&#383;&#383;ignats are di&#383;tributed to tho&#383;e who have
&#383;ons &#383;erving in the army. The tendency of both the&#383;e
donations needs no comment. The la&#383;t, which is the mo&#383;t
&#383;pecious, only affords a means of temporary profu&#383;ion to
people who&#383;e children are no incumbrance to them, while
&#383;uch as have numerous and helple&#383;s families, are left
without a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance. Even the poore&#383;t people now
regard the national paper with contempt; and, per&#383;uaded it
mu&#383;t &#383;oon be of no value, they eagerly &#383;quander
whatever they receive, without care for the future.</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>As I have frequently, in the cour&#383;e of the&#383;e letters,
had occa&#383;ion to quote from the debates of the Convention, and
other recent publications, I ought to ob&#383;erve that the French
language, like every thing el&#383;e in the country, has been a
&#383;ubject of innovation&mdash;new words have been invented, the
meaning of old ones has been changed, and a &#383;ort of jargon,
compounded of the appropriate terms of various arts and
&#383;ciences, introduced, which habit alone can render
intelligible. There is &#383;carcely a report read in the
Convention that does not exhibit every po&#383;&#383;ible example
of the Bathos, together with more conceits than are to be found in
a writer of the &#383;ixteenth century; and I doubt whether any of
their projects of legi&#383;lation or finance would be
under&#383;tood by Monte&#383;quieu or Colbert.</p>
<p>But the &#383;tyle mo&#383;t difficult to be comprehended by
foreigners, is that of the new&#383;papers; for the dread of
offending government &#383;o entirely po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;es
the imagination of tho&#383;e who compo&#383;e &#383;uch
publications, that it is not often ea&#383;y to
di&#383;tingui&#383;h a victory from a defeat, by the language in
which it is conveyed. The common news of the day is worded a&#383;
cautiou&#383;ly as though it were to be the &#383;ubject of
judicial di&#383;qui&#383;ition; and the real tendency of an
article is &#383;ometimes &#383;o much at variance with its
comment, that the whole, to a cur&#383;ory peru&#383;er, may
&#383;eem de&#383;titute of any meaning at all. Time, however, has
produced a &#383;ort of intelligence between news-writers and their
reader&#383;&mdash;and rejoicings, lamentations, prai&#383;e, or
cen&#383;ure, are, on particular occa&#383;ions, under&#383;tood to
convey the rever&#383;e of what they expre&#383;s.</p>
<p>The affected moderation of the government, and the
a&#383;cendency which &#383;ome of the Bri&#383;&#383;otin party
are beginning to take in it, &#383;eem to flatter the public with
the hope of peace. They forget that the&#383;e men were the authors
of the war, and that a few months impri&#383;onment has neither
expiated their crimes, nor &#383;ubdued their ambition. It is the
great advantage of the Bri&#383;&#383;otins, that the revolutionary
tyranny which they had contributed to e&#383;tabli&#383;h, was
wre&#383;ted from them before it had taken its full effect; but
tho&#383;e who appreciate their original claims, without regard to
their &#383;ufferings under the per&#383;ecution of a party, are
di&#383;po&#383;ed to expect they will not be le&#383;s tenacious
of power, nor le&#383;s arbitrary in the exerci&#383;e of it than
any of the intervening factions. The pre&#383;ent government is
compo&#383;ed of &#383;uch di&#383;cordant elements, that their
very union betrays that they are in fact actuated by no principle,
except the general one of retaining their authority. Lanjuinais,
Louvet, Saladin, Danou, &amp;c. are now leagued with Tallien,
Freron, Dubois de Crance, and even Carnot.</p>
<p>At the head of this motley a&#383;&#383;emblage of
Bri&#383;&#383;otins, Orleani&#383;ts, and Robe&#383;pierrians, is
Sieye&#383;&mdash;who, with perhaps le&#383;s hone&#383;ty, though
more cunning, than either, de&#383;pi&#383;es and dupes them all.
At a moment when the Convention had fallen into increa&#383;ed
contempt, and when the public affairs could no longer be conducted
by fabricators of reports and framers of decrees, the talents of
this &#383;ini&#383;ter politician became nece&#383;&#383;ary; yet
he enjoys neither the confidence of his colleagues nor that of the
people&mdash;the vanity and duplicity of his conduct
di&#383;gu&#383;t and alarm the fir&#383;t, while his reputation of
partizan of the Duke of Orlean&#383; is a rea&#383;on for
&#383;u&#383;picion in the latter. But if Sieyes has never been
able to conciliate e&#383;teem, nor attain popularity, he has at
length po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed him&#383;elf of power, and
will not ea&#383;ily be induced to relinqui&#383;h it.&mdash;Many
are of opinion, that he is &#383;ecretly machinating for the
&#383;on of his former patron; but whether he means to govern in
the name of the Duke of Orleans, or in that of the republic, it is
certain, had the French any liberty to lo&#383;e, it never could
have found a more &#383;ubtle and dangerou&#383; enemy.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* The Abbe, in his <i>"notices &#383;ur la Vie de
Sieyes,"</i> declares that his contempt and dete&#383;tation of the
colleagues "with whom hi&#383; unfortunate &#383;tars had connected
him," were &#383;o great, that he determined, from his fir&#383;t
arrival at the Convention, to take no part in public affairs. As
the&#383;e were his original &#383;entiments of the
A&#383;&#383;embly, perhaps he may hereafter explain by which of
their operations his e&#383;teem was &#383;o much reconciled, that
he ha&#383; conde&#383;cended to become their leader.</blockquote>

<p>Paris may, without exaggeration, be de&#383;cribed as in a
&#383;tate of famine. The markets are &#383;cantily &#383;upplied,
and bread, except the little di&#383;tributed by order of the
government, not to be obtained: yet the inhabitants, for the
mo&#383;t part, are not turbulent&mdash;they have learned too late,
that revolutions are not the &#383;ource of plenty, and, though
they murmur and execrate their rulers, they ab&#383;tain from
violence, and &#383;eem rather inclined to yield to de&#383;pair,
than to &#383;eek revenge. This is one proof, among a variety of
others, that the de&#383;poti&#383;m under which the French have
groaned for the la&#383;t three years, has much &#383;ubdued the
vivacity and impatience of the national character; for I know of no
period in their hi&#383;tory, when &#383;uch a combination of
per&#383;onal &#383;uffering and political di&#383;content, as
exi&#383;ts at pre&#383;ent, would not have produced &#383;ome
&#383;erious convul&#383;ion.</p>

<h2>Amiens, June 18, 1795.</h2>
<p>We returned hither ye&#383;terday, and on Friday we are to
proceed to Havre, accompanied by an order from the Committee of
Public Welfare, &#383;tating that &#383;everal Engli&#383;h
families, and our&#383;elves among the number, have been for
&#383;ome time a burthen on the genero&#383;ity of the republic,
and that for this rea&#383;on we are permitted to embark as
&#383;oon as we can find the means. This is neither true, nor very
gallant; but we are too happy in quitting the republic, to cavil
about terms, and would not exchange our pauper-like
pa&#383;&#383;ports for a con&#383;ignment of all the national
domains.</p>
<p>I have been bu&#383;y to-day in collecting and
di&#383;po&#383;ing of my papers, and though I have taken infinite
pains to conceal them, their bulk is &#383;o con&#383;iderable,
that the conveyance mu&#383;t be attended with ri&#383;k. While I
was thus employed, the ca&#383;ual peru&#383;al of &#383;ome
pa&#383;&#383;ages in my letters and notes has led me to
con&#383;ider how much my ideas of the French character and manners
differ from tho&#383;e to be found in the generality of modern
travels. My opinions are not of importance enough to require a
defence; and a con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of not having deviated
from truth makes me &#383;till more aver&#383;e from an apology.
Yet as I have in &#383;everal in&#383;tances varied from
authorities highly re&#383;pectable, it may not be improper to
endeavour to account for what has almo&#383;t the appearance of
pre&#383;umption.</p>
<p>If you examine mo&#383;t of the publications de&#383;cribing
foreign countries, you will find them generally written by authors
travelling either with the eclat of birth and riches, or,
profe&#383;&#383;ionally, as men of &#383;cience or letters. They
&#383;carcely remain in any place longer than &#383;uffices to view
the churches, and to deliver their letters of recommendation; or,
if their &#383;tay be protracted at &#383;ome capital town, it is
only to be feted from one hou&#383;e to another, among that
cla&#383;s of people who are every where alike. As &#383;oon as
they appear in &#383;ociety, their reputation as author&#383;
&#383;ets all the national and per&#383;onal vanity in it afloat.
One is polite, for the honour of his country&mdash;another is
brilliant, to recommend him&#383;elf; and the traveller cannot
a&#383;k a que&#383;tion, the an&#383;wer to which i&#383; not
intended for an honourable in&#383;ertion in his repertory of
future fame.</p>
<p>In this manner an author is pa&#383;&#383;ed from the literati
and fa&#383;hionable people of one metropolis to tho&#383;e of the
next. He goes po&#383;t through &#383;mall towns and villages,
&#383;eldom mixes with every-day life, and mu&#383;t in a great
degree depend for information on partial enquiries. He &#383;ees,
as it were, only the two extremes of human condition&mdash;the
&#383;plendour of the rich, and the mi&#383;ery of the poor; but
the manners of the intermediate cla&#383;&#383;es, which are
le&#383;s obtru&#383;ive, are not within the notice of a temporary
re&#383;ident.</p>
<p>It is not therefore extraordinary, that I, who have been
dome&#383;ticated &#383;ome years in France, who have lived among
its inhabitants without preten&#383;ions, and &#383;een them
without di&#383;gui&#383;e, &#383;hould not think them quite
&#383;o polite, elegant, gay, or &#383;u&#383;ceptible, as they
endeavour to appear to the vi&#383;itant of the day. Where objects
of curio&#383;ity only are to be de&#383;cribed, I know that a
va&#383;t number may be viewed in a very rapid progre&#383;s; yet
national character, I repeat, cannot be properly e&#383;timated but
by means of long and familiar intercour&#383;e. A per&#383;on who
is every where a &#383;tranger, mu&#383;t &#383;ee things in their
be&#383;t dre&#383;s; being the object of attention, he is
naturally di&#383;po&#383;ed to be plea&#383;ed, and many
circum&#383;tances both phy&#383;ical and moral are
pa&#383;&#383;ed over as novelties in this tran&#383;ient
communication, which might, on repetition, be found inconvenient or
di&#383;gu&#383;ting. When we are &#383;tationary, and
&#383;urrounded by our connections, we are apt to be difficult and
&#383;plenetic; but a literary traveller never thinks of
inconvenience, and &#383;till le&#383;s of being out of
humour&mdash;curio&#383;ity reconciles him to the one, and his fame
&#383;o &#383;mooths all his intercour&#383;e, that he has no plea
for the other.</p>
<p>It is probably for the&#383;e rea&#383;ons that we have &#383;o
many panegyri&#383;ts of our Gallic neighbours, and there is withal
a certain fa&#383;hion of liberality that has lately prevailed, by
which we think our&#383;elves bound to do them more than
ju&#383;tice, becau&#383;e they [are] our political enemies. For my
own part, I confe&#383;s I have merely endeavoured to be impartial,
and have not &#383;crupled to give a preference to my own country
where I believed it wa&#383; due. I make no preten&#383;ions to
that &#383;ort of co&#383;mopolitani&#383;m which i&#383; without
partialities, and affects to con&#383;ider the Chicktaw or the
Tartar&#383; of Thibet, with the &#383;ame regard as a
fellow-countryman. Such univer&#383;al philanthropi&#383;ts, I have
often &#383;u&#383;pected, are people of very cold hearts, who
fancy they love the whole world, becau&#383;e they are incapable of
loving any thing in it, and live in a &#383;tate of "moral
vagabondage," (as it i&#383; happily termed by Gregoire,) in order
to be exempted from the ties of a &#383;ettled re&#383;idence.
<i>"Le co&#383;mopolyti&#383;me de &#383;y&#383;teme et de fait
n'e&#383;t qu'un vagabondage phy&#383;ique ou moral: nous devons un
amour de preference a la &#383;ociete politique dont nous
&#383;ommes membres."</i> ["Co&#383;mopolyti&#383;m, either in
theory or in practice, is no better than a moral or phy&#383;ical
vagrancy: the political &#383;ociety of which we are members, is
entitled to a preference in our affections."]</p>
<p>Let it not be imagined, that, in drawing compari&#383;ons
between France and England, I have been influenced by per&#383;onal
&#383;uffering or per&#383;onal re&#383;entment. My opinions on the
French characters and manners were formed before the revolution,
when, though my judgment might be deficient, my heart was warm, and
my mind unprejudiced; yet whatever credit may be allowed to my
general opinions, tho&#383;e which particularly apply to the
pre&#383;ent &#383;ituation and temper of the French will probably
be di&#383;puted. When I de&#383;cribe the immen&#383;e majority of
the nation as royali&#383;ts, hating their government, and at once
indignant and &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive, tho&#383;e who have not
&#383;tudied the French character, and the progre&#383;s of the
revolution, may &#383;u&#383;pect my veracity. I can only appeal to
facts. It is not a new event in hi&#383;tory for the many to be
&#383;ubdued by the few, and this &#383;eems to be the only
in&#383;tance in which &#383;uch a po&#383;&#383;ibility has been
doubted.*</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>* It is admitted by Bri&#383;&#383;ot, who is in this
ca&#383;e competent authority, that about twenty factious
adventurers had oppre&#383;&#383;ed the Convention and the whole
country. A more impartial calculator would have been le&#383;s
moderate in the number, but the fact is the &#383;ame; and it would
be difficult to fix the period when this oppre&#383;&#383;ion
cea&#383;ed.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;The well-meaning of all cla&#383;&#383;es in France are
weak, becau&#383;e they are divided; while the &#383;mall, but
de&#383;perate factions that oppre&#383;s them, are &#383;trong in
their union, and in the po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of all the
re&#383;ources of the country.</p>
<p>Under the&#383;e circum&#383;tances, no
&#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful effort can be made; and I have collected
from various &#383;ources, that the general idea of the French at
pre&#383;ent is, to wait till the new con&#383;titution appears,
and to accept it, though it &#383;hould be even more anarchical and
tyrannic than the la&#383;t. They then hope that the Convention
will re&#383;ign their power without violence, that a new election
of repre&#383;entatives will take place, and that tho&#383;e
repre&#383;entatives, who they intend &#383;hall be men of
hone&#383;ty and property, will re&#383;tore them to the
ble&#383;&#383;ings of a moderate and permanent government.</p>

<h2>Havre, June 22, 1795.</h2>
<p>We are now in hourly expectation of &#383;ailing for England: we
have agreed with the Captain of a neutral ve&#383;&#383;el, and are
only waiting for a propitious wind. This good ally of the French
&#383;eems to be perfectly &#383;en&#383;ible of the value of a
conveyance out of the republic, and accordingly we are to pay him
about ten times more for our pa&#383;&#383;age than he would have
a&#383;ked formerly. We cho&#383;e this port in preference to
Calai&#383; or Boulogne, becau&#383;e I wi&#383;hed to &#383;ee my
friend Madame de &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; at Rouen, and leave
Angelique with her relations, who live there.</p>
<p>I walked this morning to the harbour, and &#383;eeing &#383;ome
flat-bottomed boat&#383; con&#383;tructing, a&#383;ked a French
gentleman who accompanied me, perhaps a little triumphantly, if
they were intended for a de&#383;cent on the Engli&#383;h
coa&#383;t. He replied, with great compo&#383;ure, that government
might deem it expedient (though without any views of
&#383;ucceeding) to &#383;acrifice ten or twenty thou&#383;and men
in the attempt.&mdash;It is no wonder that governments, accountable
for the lives and trea&#383;ure they ri&#383;k, are &#383;carcely
equal to a conflict &#383;u&#383;tained by &#383;uch power, and
conducted on &#383;uch principles.&mdash;But I am wearied and
di&#383;gu&#383;ted with the contemplation of this
de&#383;poti&#383;m, and I return to my country deeply and
gratefully impre&#383;&#383;ed with a &#383;en&#383;e of the
ble&#383;&#383;ings we enjoy in a free and happy
con&#383;titution.</p>

goals and en&#383;uring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

&#383;pread public &#383;upport and donations to carry out its mi&#383;&#383;ion of
increa&#383;ing the number of public domain and licen&#383;ed works that can be
freely di&#383;tributed in machine readable form acce&#383;&#383;ible by the wide&#383;t
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many &#383;mall donation&#383;

&#383;tatus with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 &#383;tates of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Profe&#383;&#383;or Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely &#383;hared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and di&#383;tributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loo&#383;e network of volunteer &#383;upport.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from &#383;everal printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unle&#383;s a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not nece&#383;&#383;arily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a &#383;ubdirectory of the &#383;ame number as the eBook'&#383;
eBook number, often in &#383;everal formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compre&#383;&#383;ed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS ba&#383;ed on &#383;eparate &#383;ources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Mo&#383;t people &#383;tart at our Web &#383;ite which has the main PG &#383;earch facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web &#383;ite includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
&#383;ub&#383;cribe to our email new&#383;letter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks po&#383;ted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories ba&#383;ed on their relea&#383;e date.  If you want to
download any of the&#383;e eBooks directly, rather than u&#383;ing the regular
&#383;earch &#383;y&#383;tem you may utilize the following addre&#383;&#383;es and ju&#383;t
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks po&#383;ted &#383;ince November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a relea&#383;e date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is ba&#383;ed on the etext number (which i&#383;
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of &#383;ingle
digits corre&#383;ponding to all but the la&#383;t digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
